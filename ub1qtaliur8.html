<div></div><div> Thirteen marine stressors are represented  in the mind map and connected between them following their potential  interactions. As we can see, the driver of all the global stressors is mainly  caused by the excess heat, which is consequence of the release of CO2  in the atmosphere.<cite>&nbsp;</cite>Ocean warming  has a way bigger impact, interacting with a lot of other stressors, such as  ocean deoxygenation -long term oxygen depletion-, referring to the loss of  oxygen from the oceans due to climate change.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Keeling2010">(Keeling et al.,  2010)</a>&nbsp;Oxygen  plays a key role in structuring marine ecosystems and controls the distribution  of essentially all marine organisms.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Gilly_2013">(Gilly et al., 2013)</a></div><div>    Moreover, ocean acidification (OA) is primary caused by the atmospheric CO2  absorbed by the ocean affecting the water chemistry.&nbsp;<b>(citation?)</b>&nbsp;The  impacts of OA are not uniform across all species, some phytoplankton, algae and  seagrass may also thrive with higher CO2&nbsp;concentrations in the ocean, as  they may increase their photosynthetic and growth rates although. However, a  more acidic environment will harm other marine species such as molluscs, corals  and some varieties of plankton. The shells and skeletons of these animals may  become less dense or strong. In the case of coral reefs this may make them more  vulnerable to dissolution storm damage and slow the recovery rate.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Haigh2015">(Haigh et al., 2015)</a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div> As a local but globally spread stressor,<b>&nbsp;</b>pollution covers a  broad range of categories but the biggest source of this stressor is non-point  source pollution which occurs as a result&nbsp;of runoff from urbanised areas  (cars, trucks, septic tanks,&nbsp;farms, livestock ranches, and timber harvest)  adding chemicals, heavy metals, oil and other pollutants which greatly affect  the water quality. Plastic has also a important impact on the ocean directly  affecting all the biota in the ocean.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Koelmans_2014">(Koelmans et al., 2014)</a></div><div>    </div><div></div><div>   The increasing frequency of blooms of nontoxic micro-algae and nuisance  macro-algae is harmful because it dramatically reduces sunlight penetration in  the water column. Large and long blooms can also draw a substantial amount of  oxygen from the water column at night during respiration. Even though these  events can occur seasonally, increasing water temperature and OA can change  their frequency and intensity favouring the expansion of dead zones.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Sherman2017">(Sherman, 2017)</a></div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>            </div>
