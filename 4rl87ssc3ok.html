These  assumptions, respectively, lead to some strengths and limitations that are  presented above.   &nbsp;</div><div>The first advantage of this method is its ability to demonstrate its  results in a simple and visualized way. This fact makes these maps a useful  tool for many education programs and also it is east to communicate the extent  of the problem to the community. Furthermore, the proposed framework can easily  be used and applied to local and regional scale assessment efforts, using a  more solid and integrated database(B. S. Halpern et al., 2008). </div><div>&nbsp;One of the first assumptions that scientists make in this method, in order  to combine stressors with variable distributions and different measurement  units, is to transform and normalize them. Additionally, as scientists have not  yet completely understood when, where or why non-additive responses  (synergistic and antagonistic) occur (Crain et al. 2008, Darling and Cote 2008)  they consider that cumulative stressor impacts are additive. The drawback of these  decisions is that the examined habitats will respond linearly to possible  changes. It is almost undoubtful, however, that such linear responses of  ecosystems to multiple stressors are the exception rather than the rule and  this could lead to insufficient results(Benjamin S. Halpern &amp; Fujita, 2013). Lastly, cumulative  impact mapping can rarely take into account historical references, even though  they are crucial to understanding how an area is affected by the various human  impacts on it.</div><h2 data-label="603973" class="ltx_title_subsection">Impact Rating</h2><div>Impact rating is a rather simple, easily scalable method, where different criteria are used for ranking or rating the impacts and effects of the multiple stressors in the ecosystem. This is mostly happenning through an expert elicitation in form of a survey.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley_2017,Micheli_2013,Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>These methods are not always simple and cost-effective to collect, evaluate and rank, because you need a lot of data and expert opinions. Furthermore, the expert elicition has a high possibility to be biased. Therefore, also the possibilityof applying the method&nbsp; to other locations and studies, giving reliable information about the examined ecosystem, depends on the sufficienty of the data. This makes it difficult to provide early warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple stressors over time and to&nbsp;provide a future envision on possible interactions between the multile stresssors and ecosystem's degratation.</div><div>So all in all, the impact rating often rather goes together with other methods, such as modelling or indexes, to&nbsp;display the change of interest and provide sufficient results for the whole ecosystem in a scale or rating system, than being communicated as a single method.</div><h2 data-label="874536" class="ltx_title_subsection">Indexes</h2><div> Indexes represent scientific results in a simple, numerical way and thereby give an general general overview of the assessment results. This gives the method&nbsp;of indexes the ability to display a rather complex investigation in an clear way. Due to that indicators seem to be useful as a baseline which indicate a focus and can be related to in further studies. At the same time this simple approach can also be too facile or vacuous since it only gives a number as outcome. Without looking at the evaluation how this number was constructed or an explanation which are the causes for this outcome, one might not understand the exact statement and validity of the index, especially if it is a highly complex index. Therefore the communicabilty, especially to laypeople, which represent the broader audience, is decreasing in value or remains rather trivial. Combing the index with a further method such as mapping could benefit the communicability. Indexes being a mathematical contruct of various variables are fairly sensitive and reactive to changes, due to the fact that a change of number of one variable directly effects the calculation. However the effectivesness of the index remains dependant on the individual index. The Ocean Health Index, which has already been mentioned earlier in the paper is a quite comprehensive index to illustrate ocean health. But this broad spectrum of evaluation also gives the possibilty of lack of data, hence the measureabilty as well as the sensitivity of the index declines.</div><h3 data-label="837411" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Recommended order and steps in multiple stressor assessments </h3><h3 data-label="837411" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    </h3><div>IDEA (Based on AOPs " Interactions between chemical and climate stressors: A role for mechanistic toxicology in assessing climate change risks"):</div><ul><li>Make a large, shared database of various impact pathways, each described in a unified way.</li><li>Then, incorporate this database into software that can assemble complex AOPs, integrating the impacts into a prediction of the outcome of the population in question.</li><li>The results might not always be accurate, but they can give an inclination of the possible outcomes.</li></ul><div>STEPS:</div><ol><li><b>Stressor ranking and identification (stessor inventory):</b> "Rating impacts in a multi-stressor world: a quantitive assessment of 50 stressors affecting the Great Lakes"</li><li><b>Cumulative impact mapping:</b> "Mapping cumulative human impacts to California Current marine ecosystems"</li><li><b>Ecological network map</b> (conceptual ecosystem or community model)</li><li><b>Interstressor effects and causative relation to potential biological changes</b> (AOPs): "Characterizing driver-response relationships in marine pelagic ecosystems for improved ocean management"</li></ol><div></div><h1 data-label="662332" class="ltx_title_section">

It is the largest living structure on earth, stretching for over 2300 km in the northern-east region of Australia. While being mostly known for the endless network of coral reefs, its intricate architecture also provides a home for a great amount of animals and plants, creating one of the most biodiverse and complex ecosystem on the planet. Unfortunately&nbsp; the functional biodiversity of the GBR renders its system highly susceptible to even the smallest change in the balance acquired with thousands of years of evolution&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mouillot_2014}</cite>.&nbsp;</div>
