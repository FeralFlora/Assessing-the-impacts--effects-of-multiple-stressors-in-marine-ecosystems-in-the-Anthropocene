<div></div><h3 data-label="381601" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Appropriation of methods to the steps</h3><div>Having laid out the steps and explained their reasoning, we'll now present which specific methods we find appropriate and sufficient for the steps, based on our literature review. Some of the steps, such as step one, don't necessarily require a specific method or to be explicitly defined, as they just require due diligence and proper consideration. The recommended coupling of specific methods to steps isn't necessarily the only option, and this will be highlighted where it applies, and it other cases - especially the last one - our results are less conclusive than in the other steps, so the several methods will be discussed for this step in the discussion section.</div><div><b>Step 1</b></div><div><b><b>Step 2</b></b></div><div><i><u>Anthropocene Baselines: Assessing Change and Managing Biodiversity in Human-Dominated Aquatic Ecosystems</u></i></div><div><i><u>Ghost reefs: Nautical charts document large spatial scale of coral reef loss over 240 years</u></i></div><div><i><u></u></i> Multiple marine ecological disturbance assessments for latin american and caribbean large marine ecosystems<i><u></u></i></div>
