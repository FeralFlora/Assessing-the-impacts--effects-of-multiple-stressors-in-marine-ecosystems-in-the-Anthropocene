<div>As we previously stated, a stressor is&nbsp;&nbsp;                                    an abiotic or biotic factor changing the  ecosystem. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner_2014}</cite>        </div><div>We can group marine stressors in two main categories: a group that acts globally such as increased temperature, ocean deoxygenation (the global trend of decreasing oxygen as a result of ocean warming and increasing stratification) and ocean acidification; and those that act at a local to regional level but occur globally, such as overfishing which is responsible of species loss and population collapse due to the chain effect it has on all the food chain, pollution and hypoxia.&nbsp;</div>
