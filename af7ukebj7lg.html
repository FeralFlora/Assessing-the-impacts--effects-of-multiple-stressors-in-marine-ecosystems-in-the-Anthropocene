<div>The  driver of all the global stressors is mainly caused by the excessive release of CO2 in the atmosphere. Although other gasses, like methane (CH4&nbsp;)and nitrous oxide (N2O) have a great negative impact on the atmosphere, their effect  will respectively last a decade&nbsp;(CH4) and about a century (N2O)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep[see][]{Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change}</cite>, every time CO2 is released, 40% will stay airborne 100 years and 20% will reside for 1000 years, while the final 10% will take 10,000 years to turn over&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{2014}</cite>. The ocean is affected directly from the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere with and estimation&nbsp;that 26 percent of all the carbon released as CO2 is absorbed by the ocean (The global carbon budget 1959â€“2011 C. Le Quere).&nbsp;</div>
