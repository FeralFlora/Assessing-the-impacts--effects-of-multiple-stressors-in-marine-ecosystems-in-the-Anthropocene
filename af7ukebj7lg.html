<div>The  driver of all the global stressors is mainly caused by the excessive release of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Although other gasses, like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) have a great negative impact on the atmosphere, their effect  will respectively last a decade&nbsp;(CH<sub>4</sub>) and about a century (N<sub>2</sub>O), every time CO<sub>2</sub> is released, 40% will stay airborne 100 years and 20% will reside for 1000 years, while the final 10% will take 10,000 years to turn over&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014}</cite>. The ocean is affected directly from the increase of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere with and estimation&nbsp;that 26% of all the carbon released as CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed by the ocean.</div>
