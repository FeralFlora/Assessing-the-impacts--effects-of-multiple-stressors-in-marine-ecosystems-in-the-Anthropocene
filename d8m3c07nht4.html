They are followed by the carnivores, also called&nbsp;secondary and tertiary consumers,  that occupy the third and last trophic level. In addition, there is a group  called&nbsp;decomposers, existing on  waste and dead remains, that breakdown all the organic matter.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sumich2016}</cite>  All of them form a&nbsp;food web in which all the organisms  rely on the organic matter produced by primary producers. In the ocean, the  principal primary producers are phytoplankton, zooplankton are the primary  consumers and the rest are secondary and tertiary consumers.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gaedke2009}</cite></div>
