<div>The health of the GBR in recent years has alarmed scientist all over the world. Climate change induced stressors (Ocean warming, OA and increasing tropical cyclones) have been combining with local stressors; change in water quality caused by terrestrial runoffs of sediments, agricultural nutrients, pesticides, overfishing and ship traffic, all of which contributes in affecting the resilience of the reef, limiting the coral's possibility  to recover from stress, thus leading to degradation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Brodie_2012,Wolff_2016}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>Therefore, for this assessment exercise, the goal of the assessment would be to untan the causes of observed stress on coral ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef, especially in light of the catastrophic devastation of heat stress and bleaching, to hopefully identify local stressors that compromise Coral's resilience to guide short term management efforts towards these factors, whilst continuing the efforts to mitigate anthropogenic global warming.</div>
