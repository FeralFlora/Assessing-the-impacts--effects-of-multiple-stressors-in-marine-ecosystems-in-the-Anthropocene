<div>  Thirteen marine stressors are represented  in the mind map and connected between them are their potential  interactions. As we can see, the driver of all global stressors is mainly  caused by the excess heat, which is the consequence  of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;being released into the atmosphere.<cite>&nbsp;</cite>Ocean warming  has a greater impact on the marine environment compared to other stressors; it interacts with so many other stressors. One example being ocean deoxygenation the long term oxygen depletion, referring to the loss of  oxygen from the oceans due to climate change&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Keeling2010">(Keeling et al.,  2010)</a>.&nbsp;Oxygen  plays a crucial role in structuring marine ecosystems and it controls the distribution  of essentially all marine organisms.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Gilly_2013">(Gilly et al., 2013)</a></div><div>    Moreover, ocean acidification (OA) is primarily caused by the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>  absorbed by the ocean affecting the water chemistry.&nbsp;The  impacts of OA are not uniform across all species, some phytoplankton, algae and  seagrass may also thrive with higher CO2&nbsp;concentrations in the ocean, as  they may increase their photosynthetic and growth rates. However, a  more acidic environment will harm other marine species such as molluscs, corals  and some species of plankton. The shells and skeletons of these animals may  become less dense or weaker. In the case of coral reefs, this may make them more  vulnerable to dissolution, storm damage and slower recovery rates.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Haigh2015">(Haigh et al., 2015)</a></div><div>As a local but globally spread stressor,<b>&nbsp;</b>pollution covers a  broad range of categories but the biggest source of this stressor is non-point  source pollution which occurs as a result&nbsp;of runoff from urbanized areas  (e.g. cars, trucks, septic tanks,&nbsp;farms, livestock ranches, and timber harvest)  adding chemicals, heavy metals, oil and other pollutants which greatly affect  the water quality. Plastic has also an important impact on the ocean, directly  affecting all the biota in the ocean.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Koelmans_2014">(Koelmans et al., 2014)</a></div><div>    The increasing frequency of blooms of nontoxic micro-algae and nuisance  macro-algae is harmful because it dramatically reduces sunlight penetration in  the water column. Large and long blooms can also draw a substantial amount of  oxygen from the water column at night during respiration. Even though these  events can occur seasonally, increasing water temperature and OA can change  their frequency and intensity favoring the expansion of dead zones.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/176118/articles/212065-assessing-the-impacts-effects-of-multiple-stressors-in-marine-ecosystems-in-the-anthropocene#Sherman2017">(Sherman, 2017)</a></div><h1 data-label="501673" class="ltx_title_section">                                            </h1><h2 data-label="493159" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multiple stressors and assessment methods</h2><div>
As the preceding sections has shown, the challenges of effectively and accurately assessing and predicting  outcomes of multiple stressors acting in parallel on marine ecosystems lie in the inherent complexity of the task - arising both from the interwoven nature of ecosystems with webbed relationships of direct and&nbsp;indirect interdependence, as well as the overlapping and interacting effects of the stressors themselves.&nbsp;</div><div>The ecosystems affected by multiple stressors can not be assumed to be in any one stable state, when assessed long-term or even inter-annually, as the ongoing effects of human impacts and systemic alterations to the biosphere continue to develop in magnitude, multitude and spatial extent, thus forcing future assessment and management efforts to take on a more holistic, dynamic and earth-system/ecologically insightful approach to avoid non-linear effects and resultant ecological surprises, which might otherwise thwart the  efforts to stave of the ongoing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ceballos_2015}</cite> (or conservatively, impending&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rothman_2017}</cite>) Sixth Mass Extinction. As a result, given the multivariate nature and complexity of the issue, univariate impact assessments may well be rendered effectively obsolete in most future oceanic contexts, except when conducted as part of  systemic analyses.</div><div>Paradoxically, there is simultaneously a need to pay greater attention to specific characteristics of stressors, biological receptors and their physical environments and the dynamics and interactions between them, and a need to simplify these complexities in a way that allows for effective analysis in a timely manner while balancing holism and information overload. The latter need is underlined by the urgency of the biodiversity and ecosystem stability crisis.</div><div>We'll now consider the conventional approaches to impact assessments - mainly ecotoxicology - and highlight some of their strengths as well as the pitfalls that have inspired the efforts to develop new approaches, both in extension of the existing methods and novel ways&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanStraalen2003}</cite>. Thereafter, we'll give a rough outline of general themes in&nbsp;multiple stressor assessments, which are expanded upon in the section  of the report.</div><h3 data-label="509487" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Conventional ecological risk and impact assessments and their pitfalls&nbsp;</h3><div></div>
