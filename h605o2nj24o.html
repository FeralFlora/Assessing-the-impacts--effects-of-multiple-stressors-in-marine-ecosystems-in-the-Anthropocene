As the preceding sections have shown, the challenges of effectively and accurately assessing and predicting the outcomes of multiple stressors acting in parallel on marine ecosystems lie in the inherent complexity of the task - arising both from the interwoven nature of ecosystems with relationships of direct and&nbsp; indirect interdependence, as well as the overlapping effects of the stressors themselves. The ecosystems affected by multiple stressors can not be assumed to be in any one stable state, when assessed long-term or even inter-annually, as the ongoing effects of human impacts and systemic alterations to the biosphere continue to develop in magnitude, multitude and spatial extent, thus forcing future assessment and management efforts to take on a more holistic, dynamic and earth-system and ecologically insightful approach.
