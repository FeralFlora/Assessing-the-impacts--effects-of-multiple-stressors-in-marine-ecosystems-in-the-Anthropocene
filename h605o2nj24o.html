As the preceding sections have shown, the challenges of effectively and accurately assessing and predicting the outcomes of multiple stressors acting in parallel on marine ecosystems lie in the inherent complexity of the task - arising both from the interwoven nature of ecosystems with webbed relationships of direct and&nbsp; indirect interdependence, as well as the overlapping effects of the stressors themselves. The ecosystems affected by multiple stressors can not be assumed to be in any one stable state, when assessed long-term or even inter-annually, as the ongoing effects of human impacts and systemic alterations to the biosphere continue to develop in magnitude, multitude and spatial extent, thus forcing future assessment and management efforts to take on a more holistic, dynamic and earth-system / ecologically insightful approach to avoid non-linear effects and resultant ecological surprises, which might otherwise thwart the  efforts to stave of the ongoing (or conservatively, impending) Sixth Mass Extinction. As a result, given the multivariate nature and complexity of the issue, univariate impact assessments may well be rendered effectively obsolete in future oceanic contexts, except when conducted as part of  systemic analyses.</div><div>Paradoxically, there is simultaneously a need to pay greater attention to specific characteristics of stressors, biological receptors and their physical environments and the dynamics and interactions between these, and a need to simplify these complexities in a way that allows for effective analysis in an timely manner, balancing holism and information overload. Thi</div><div>We'll now consider the conventional approaches to impact assessments and highlight some of their strengths and the pitfalls that have inspired the efforts to develop new approaches, both in extension of the preceding methods and in novel ways. Thereafter, we'll give a rough outline of general themes in&nbsp; multiple stressor assessments</div><div></div><h3 data-label="293052" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Stressor inventory: Mindmap
