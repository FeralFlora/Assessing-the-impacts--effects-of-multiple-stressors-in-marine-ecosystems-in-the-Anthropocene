<div></div><h2 data-label="848109" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multivariate vs. univariate assessments</h2><div>In relation to the aforementioned balancing act between accuracy and practicality, some approaches to the multiple stressor issue take a different route towards describing multiple stressor impacts, namely identifying either a single or a few key indicators of ecosystem health or conversely ecosystem stress to estimate cumulative impacts in this single "currency" across different types of stressor, which all might influence this characteristic. The goal is to identify a measure that is sufficiently universal, sensitive and measurable so as to effective inform assessments of multiple stressor impacts through simple means.</div><div><b>Single currency approaches (univariate):</b></div><ul><li>Cumulative impact mapping: "Assumptions, challenges, and future directions

So we need to understand and account for the  cumulative effects of multiple stressors to get a holistic and representative  view on the consequences of human activities upon the natural systems that  constitute our home and the basis of society. Counter to this need, science  tends to be practiced too narrowly, allowing great insight into specifics  without necessarily providing an adequate view of the full picture. Moreover,  we need to be able to assess and predict how marine organisms and their  ecosystems will adapt and respond to different stressors acting in unison, to  make reasonable predictions for the future development of these ecosystems.&nbsp;</div><div>    Multivariate  stressors deal with more than one variable. An example of these models is the practice  of cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM), a method of modifying  existing tools for univariate stressors, such as environmental impact  assessment (EIA), for specific valued ecosystem components (VECs) for the use  of CEAM. This method tries to assess cumulative effects for multiple actions  using the tools of “encompass indicators, environmental indices, and habitat  suitability models bases on pertinent indices” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Canter_2011}</cite>. Thus indicators and indices, dealing with only one  variable or metric, are used for environmental studies creating an index or  modelling. Assessing multivariate effects, one can see the potential adaption  of these EIA tools for the usage in CEAM. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Canter_2011}</cite></div><div>    So the often found too narrowly research of  scientists, concentrating only on one or a few stressor(s), gives us a great  detailed knowledge about their used tools. Furthermore, they make specific  predictions about future perspectives of ecosystem adaptions. Using this  knowledge and modifying the tools for assessing these univariate stressors to  assess multivariate stressors, one can get a realistic picture of the  cumulative effects and the different stressors interacting to make reasonable  predictions for the future development of these ecosystems.</div><h2>Overview of approaches to multiple stressor impact assessments</h2><div>                                        A diverse selection of literature reviews and articles were found as research types in our  search for methods of assessing multiple stressors, which are applicable to  marine ecosystems. Categorizing the methods used in multiple stressor  assessments into  a one-size-fits-all type is not particularly useful  since they overlap one another and furthermore can be used in diverse reviews  and assessments. Therefore, describing the main findings and similarities  between them is what we will explain instead, in hopes that there is a  proceeding conceptual method in which could be applied to assessing multiple  stressors in the marine environment.&nbsp;</div>
