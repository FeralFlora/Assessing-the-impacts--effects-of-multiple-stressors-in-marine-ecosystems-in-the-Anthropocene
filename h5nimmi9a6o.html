<div></div><h3>                                  Single trophic level indicators</h3><div>           Primary producers are indicators which consist of the  phytoplankton and the phytobenthic groups. Tracking phytoplanktons’ fast  growth rates and response to low levels pollutants, scientists can  identify sensitive and early signs­­ of ecological changes and  environmental disturbance in marine surface waters.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{PAERL_2003}</cite>&nbsp;Phytobenthic  groups are sensitive indicators of changes in marine environments as  they  live long and they usually are sessile organisms.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,VanHoey2010}</cite>&nbsp;Macrobenthic  communities also undergo chronic disturbances which affect their  diversity, total abundance and total biomass and this may help the  scientists identify modifications in the trophic structure and  functioning of an ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,Dauvin_2007,Warwick_1994,article}</cite></div><div>Primary  consumer indicators include the zooplankton and zoobenthic groups. In  2005, the professor Weijerman mentioned that the abundance of  zooplankton species can be used to document sudden ecosystem shifts in  different regions of the world and also help identify the effects of  global warming and its consequences on regional hydrodynamics. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Beaugrand2009}</cite>&nbsp;As  regard to zoobenthic groups, their structural characteristics can be  useful to monitor the impacts of environmental stress in coastal systems  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007}</cite>&nbsp;and they can also be used in detecting early environmental disturbances, especially in estuarine habitats.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007,Elliott2007}</cite></div><h3>Two or more trophic level indicators</h3><div>The  restriction of using these empirical estimated indicators, however, is  that they can demonstrate the state of an ecosystem examining only a  single trophic level. The need for assessing the ecosystem health in two  or more trophic levels led scientists to introduce different  approaches. </div><div>The use of stable isotope profiles as  environmental and trophic indicators is a supporting tool to study  feeding habits, nutrient tracking, species migrations and habitat use of  species and communities in the ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Thompson}</cite> In addition, modelling techniques have been introduced to study ecosystem responses to different stressors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Christensen2007}</cite>&nbsp;An  ecosystem model can be used to compute a group of indicators describing  the physical attributes, lower trophic levels (phyto- and zooplankton  mainly in pelagic systems), higher trophic levels, and ecosystem  principles. Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling  techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the  ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an  indicator would take under different situations. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><div>Another approach, proposed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hattam2015}</cite>,  using the Dogger Bank as a case study, underlines the need to link  indicators into three main classifications. Ecosystem services, the  first classification,&nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of  ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010). Ecosystem functions, the  second classification refers to ecological mechanisms which regulate the  flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cardinale2012}</cite>   The classification ecosystem benefits describe the processed output  from ecosystem services, which is thereby no longer linked to the  ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haines-Young2012}</cite>  Identifying sufficient service, function and benefit indicators  remains a challenge due to the complexity of marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</div><div>However,  once the proper indicators for each classification are chosen, and they  are assessed in conjunction, they can give a more complete  understanding of how an ecosystem changes.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>                                        This change  leads us to the  different impacts causing the ecosystem change and their short and long  term considerations.</div><h3 data-label="455145" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Short term and long term consideratins</h3><div>Due  to the fact, that the main research goal of this project is to contribute to  greater understanding of how to assess the impacts and effects of multiple  stressors in marine ecosystems in our current time of climate and environmental  change, we should try to simplify this complex web of different stressors  interacting with each other to get a general overview of the ongoing changes.  Thus, it is beneficial to review the concept of assessing ecosystem health to  understand the assessing of multiple stressors and their interactions.</div><div>As already shown before, the  “aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome” lists different symptoms characterizing  ecosystem health.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite>&nbsp;All these  symptoms are examples for&nbsp;abiotic and biotic factors in ecosystems for which one can apply the maxim for complex metabolic or ecosystem processes, called  “Blackman’s principle”. According to this principle, the rate of the process is  limited by the pace of the slowest abiotic or biotic factor, when the process  is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors. Blackman used this principle specifically to describe the metabolic process of photosynthesis.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{BLACKMAN_1905}</cite>&nbsp;To  illustrate this, imagine a large wine cask, where one of the planks is shorter  than the others. This means it is not possible to fill more wine in the cask  than the high of the shortest plank. The shortest plank in this case functions  as a metaphor for the limiting abiotic or biotic factor.&nbsp;</div><div>    Transferring  this concept to an ecosystem with multiple interacting stressors, this could  help to find a method for assessing multiple stressors and improve their  impacts and effects on marine ecosystems. Considering different ways of  classifying, grouping, quantifying and understanding stressors and the systems  they impact at various organizational levels, according to the Blackman’s  principle, there (probably) is a limiting factor. </div><div>    In a  study of the Australian Institute of Marine Science it is mentioned, that in a  short time perspective, it could help to improve local stressors with an acute  impact in marine ecosystems, but in long term there is most likely a  stabilization of the ocean temperature needed to prevent the coral losses in  marine ecosystems, because, in this case, temperature as a stressor causes a  lot of other negative impacts and effects on the marine ecosystems. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{De_ath_2012}</cite>&nbsp;Thus, temperature would be the limiting factor or stressor. This means, even if  one, theoretically, improves all other stressors, in a long term perspective not  all changes in the ecosystem health could be prevented, due temperature rise  would still have a quite big impact on the condition of the ecosystem. </div><div>    The  Blackman’s principle thus gives us a general idea on how to improve ecosystem  health and minimize the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in a long  term perspective by finding the limiting stressor, which is most likely the  rise of CO<sub>2</sub> and thus temperature.</div><div>    So  all in all, the concept of ecosystem health could be useful to be able to  assess and predict how marine organisms and their ecosystems will adapt and  respond to different stressors acting in unison, and also which the most significant  or substantial ones are, so we can suggest a systematic framework of these  colossal changes to integrate the effects less universal stressors into.</div><h1 data-label="147465" class="ltx_title_section">                     &nbsp;</h1><h2 data-label="444527" class="ltx_title_subsection">Key stressors and potential interactions&nbsp;</h2><div>                              The complexity of the assessment of  multiple stressors lies in the complexity of the interactions themselves.<i>&nbsp;</i>Even though great advances in this  field have been done, most cumulative effects of mutual influences between  stressors remains uncertain.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>First of all, stressors are defined as “any  external abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its  normal operating range” <a href="#Segner2014"><i>(Segner et al., 2014)</i></a> It is important to differentiate the concepts: stressor, stress, and stress  response.&nbsp;While a stressor is an external factor,&nbsp;stress is an  internal state created by a stressor, and&nbsp;stress response is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress.&nbsp;<a href="#StraalenN__dot__M__dot__2003"><i>(Straalen N.M., 2003)</i></a></div><div><b>ALTERNATIVE TERMS AND DISTINCTIONS / WRITE ABOUT ME!</b></div>
