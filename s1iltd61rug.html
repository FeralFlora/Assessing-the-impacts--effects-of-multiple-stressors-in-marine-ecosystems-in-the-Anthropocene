<div></div><div>After the baseline assessment, with critical decisions about the applicability of historical and anthropocene baselines, an ecosystem model is developed and established as the foundation for the rest of the assessment process. The ecosystem model should be developed with ecosystem health considerations in mind that seek to identify the critical components of the ecosystem such as keystone species, foundation and habitat forming species. Furthermore, it should associate these receptors with appropriate bioindicators, which may prove to be challenging. There is an ongoing need to develop dynamic ecosystem models and validate these with empirical analyses to refine proposed indicators, but integrative developments whereby indices are aggregated and combined according to their complementary strengths show promise - especially when combining indicators related to structural attributes at the community-level with biotic indices based on functional and/or structural attributes of sentinel or indicator species. In relation to the ecosystem health understanding, the combination of indicators should seek to represent different aspects of ecosystem health.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts2013a,Mart_nez_Crego_2010}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Whilst the previously described Ocean Health Index (OHI) is holistic in the sense that it incorporates many    socio-ecological     aspects of ecosystems and integrates human interests with ecosystem health, which helps valuing natural resources, we find it to be ill fitting for complex multiple stressor assessments. However, one conceptual aspect of this framework is important to highlight, namely the insistence on maintaining the key characteristics and priorities of the assessment framework regardless of information limitations, as it is deemed preferable to represent all key characteristics of the ecosystem, even if compensatory assumptions must be made&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2015}</cite> In accordance with this,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hallett2012}</cite> present a novel method for selecting appropriate ecosystem health metrics, when sufficient independent measures of ecological condition are lacking, although the results of such analyses still require empirical testing and validation before being integrated into assessments. This validation need means that if an assessment is the first to be conducted in accordance with our recommended approach for a particular region or ecosystem, this first assessment would face greater challenges than the preceding ones, and should therefore be regarded as pioneering assessments that establish a foundation for future assessments.</div><div></div><div>For multiple stressor assessments, we recommend the ecosystem health definition of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Tett2013}</cite> for its practicality and relevance, as it can guide the assessment process rather than just serve as a metaphor through the integration of the concepts vigor, organisation and resilience. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{305723}</span> shows an ecosystem model that incorporates ecosystem health information in accordance with the definition of Tett et al.. The white arrows, representing both abiotic and biotic ecosystem components and their relationships should be explicitly defined to a realistic degree, when conducting a multiple stressor assessment, but the diagram portrays the general type of conceptual coupled ecosystem and ecosystem&nbsp;health model, we have in mind. Pressures are (drivers and stressors) can be left simplified at this stage, as the refinement of this information is left to later stages.</div><div></div>
