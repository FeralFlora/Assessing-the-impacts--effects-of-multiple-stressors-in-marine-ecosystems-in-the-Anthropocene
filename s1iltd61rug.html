<div></div><div>After the baseline assessment, with critical decisions about the applicability of historical and anthropocene baselines, an ecosystem model is developed and established as the foundation for the rest of the assessment process. The ecosystem model should be developed with ecosystem health considerations in mind that seek to identify the critical components of the ecosystem such as keystone species, foundation and habitat forming species. Furthermore, it should associate these receptors with appropriate bioindicators, which may prove to be challenging. There is an ongoing need to develop dynamic ecosystem models and validate these with empirical analyses to refine proposed indicators, but integrative developments whereby indices are aggregated and combined according to their complementary strengths show promise - especially when combining indicators related to structural attributes at the community-level with biotic indices based on functional and/or structural attributes of sentinel or indicator species. In relation to the ecosystem health understanding, the combination of indicators should seek to represent different aspects of ecosystem health.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts2013a,Mart_nez_Crego_2010}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Whilst the previously described Ocean Health Index (OHI) is holistic in the sense that it incorporates many    sosio-ecological     aspects of ecosystems and integrates human interests with ecosystem health, which helps valuing natural resources, we find it to be ill fitting for complex multiple stressor assessments. However, one conceptual aspect of this framework is important to highlight, namely the insistence on maintaining the key characteristics and priorities of the assessment framework regardless of information limitations, as it is deemed preferable to represent all key characteristics of the ecosystem, even if compensatory assumptions must be made&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2015}</cite> In accordance with this,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hallett2012}</cite> present a novel method for selecting appropriate ecosystem health metrics, when sufficient independent measures of ecological condition are lacking, although the results of such analyses still require testing and validation before being integrated into</div><div></div><div></div><div>setbacks of tiered approach</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>P37 - C6 in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones2016}</cite> <b>Stressor based vs Effects based indicators</b></li><li>P45<b>&nbsp;Each step involves decisions and considerations</b></li><li>P48&nbsp;<b>Ecological Complexity precludes certainty</b></li><li>P53&nbsp;<b>Transparency and public participation facilitate rational decision-making</b></li><li>P88&nbsp;<b>Project-based assessments &lt; regional assessments</b></li><li>C11&nbsp;Basic knowledge about ecological stressors and effects is <b>rudimentary</b>. Nonetheless, numerical methods for quantifying, assessing, modelling, and predicting cumulative effects are well described.

are relatively well described, but the required monitoring data are generally lacking (Dammanet al. 1995; Scherer 2011; Schultz 2012; Ball et al. 2013; Venier et al. 2014), and are “expensive and time consuming to gather” (Connelly 2011). Obviously, more complex models call for more complex input datasets and underlying monitoring programs, so a vicious cycle is apparent (Gallagher et al. 2015). The information that is available is “highly uncertain and variable in quality” (Karkkainen 2002), and is, for the most part, not efficiently shared among CEA participants (Damman et al. 1995).</i></li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="713045" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Challenges </h2><div>Assessing the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems itself is one of the biggest challenges in science.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite>&nbsp;But why is this assessment that challenging?&nbsp;Trying to make a&nbsp;holistic or ecosystem-based perspective is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses. This is due to the complexity of the topic and a huge lack of data, such as the still only partly understood interactions among multiple stressors in marine ecosystems. Therefore, considerable future reseacrh is needed to&nbsp;improve the contribution these system models make to understand interactions among multiple stressors.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></div><div>Fundamental questions in this research section are, whether the&nbsp;expected joint effect of a cumulative impact and effect is higher or lower than the intensity of each single stressor. Moreover,&nbsp;it is critical to assess whether the various stressors are overlapping in time and space to result in a potential cumulative effect.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite>&nbsp;Therefore, marine stressors can be grouped into stressors acting  globally and those that  act at in a local to regional level but occur globally.&nbsp;<a href="#Porter1999"><i>(Porter  et al., 1999)</i></a>&nbsp;Additionally, the recovery potential of an ecosystem might be important to differenciate between multi- and univariate stressors' impacts. Another question is whether the cumulative effect of multivariate stressors just quantitatively differ from the effect of single stressors or if there are new effects and responses, which differ from the expected or predicted outcome.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite>&nbsp;This problem is shown by categorizing the different stressors and their interactions into synergistic, antagonistic and additive effects.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite> These considered interactions and decisions about the necessary input data, the running of the model and the description of the final uncertainty in the model influence the expected size, such as magnitude, extent and intensity of the stressors caused by the given combination of stressors.&nbsp;Another problem in relation to the aforementioned balancing act between accuracy and practicality is the lack of consistency or standardization in approaches, definitions and vocabulary of cumulative impacts assessment. This lack of clarity leads to a recommendation of looking critical on defining the scope of the assessment and the best fitting methodologies. As one can see before, the recommended steps of assessing multiple stressors are a mixture of different methods, collecting the best fitting methodologies. Although there still exist various definitions of how to describe cumulative impact assessment, one can say, that all cumulative effect assessments are based on an ecosystem approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite>&nbsp;This need for the development of an ecosystem based approach to the assessment of cumulative impacts from multiple stressors has been recognized and emphasized for decades&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Wrona1996}</cite>. Therefore, it is important to get an&nbsp;integrated knowledge of ecosystem structure and function, a&nbsp;holistic overview of the interacting stressors at different organizational, spatial and temporal scales within the ecosystem and to develop management strategies that are ecological, anticipatory and ethical.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Christie_1986,Judd_2015,Wrona1996}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>So cumulative effects assessments involve assessing and evaluating the interactions between multiple stressors with multiple effects on multiple ecosystem components. This complex web of interactions of direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors quickly generates a complicated and unwieldy network of multiple interactions. How to manage and assess this complexity is a challenge to all forms of cumulative effects assessment. The assessment of multiple stressors and their impacts and effects is&nbsp;clearly impractical. Therefore the application of environmental risk assessment principles allows  a meaningful and achievable assessment for multiple stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite> Environmental risk assessment is a process of choice, based on identifying the likely consequences of different oeffects and impacts and selecting the best actions &nbsp;to minimising and managing environmental risks.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{University2011}</cite></div><h2 data-label="593218" class="ltx_title_subsection"> 	Case study: Exploration of hypothetical assessment of the Great Barrier Reef</h2><div>    By applying our proposed steps explained in the results,  we'll make and explore a hypothetical  assessment of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), using articles previously analyzed during our research process to give practical examples, whenever possible, on how each step can be executed and its goal achieved.   &nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="686126" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">1.
