<div>Furthermore,arine organisms are classified in three  groups. Firstly,&nbsp;benthos live in the  ocean bottom and can be&nbsp;epifauna if they  are on the surface or&nbsp;infauna if  they live buried.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sumich2016}</cite>&nbsp;Nekton<b>&nbsp;</b>is formed by all the animals  that move freely of the currents and&nbsp;Plankton  comprises all the organisms that drift with water flows.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Webber1991}</cite> Plankton have an  important role in marine biogeochemical cycles, for that reason also affect the  chemical composition of sea water.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Mullin2001}</cite></div><div>However, once the proper indicators for each classification are chosen, and they are assessed in conjunction, they can give a more complete understanding of how an ecosystem change.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>                                       This change  leads us to the different impacts causing the ecosystem change and their short and long term considerations.</div><h3 data-label="455145" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Short term and long term considerations</h3><div>                                        &nbsp;As already  shown before, using an already known concept to describe a new problem could  help to simplify and understand several complex topics. So there was an  application of a human health metaphor suggested to transfer this on assessing  ecosystem health using different indicators. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite></div><div>    Due  to the fact, that the main research goal of this project is to contribute to  greater understanding of how to assess the impacts and effects of multiple  stressors in marine ecosystems in our current time of climate and environmental  change, we should try to simplify this complex web of different stressors  interacting with each other to get a general overview of the ongoing changes.  Thus, it is beneficial to review the concept of assessing ecosystem health to  understand the assessing of multiple stressors and their interactions.</div><div>    The  “aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome” lists different symptoms characterizing  ecosystem health, such as: alteration in biotic community structure to favour  smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by ‘r’ selected  species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened food-chain length,  increased disease prevalence, and reduced population stability.  All these  symptoms are abiotic and biotic factors in ecosystems and there are more, such  as temperature, pH, nutrients, gas concentration, species concurrence,  migration, etc. For all these abiotic and biotic factors one can apply the  general legitimacy for complex metabolic or ecosystem processes, called  “Blackman’s principle”. According to this principle, the rate of the process is  limited by the pace of the slowest abiotic or biotic factor, when the process  is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors.<a> (Blackman,  1905)</a><a href="#_msocom_1">[TM1]</a>&nbsp; To  illustrate this, imagine a large wine cask, where one of the planks is shorter  than the others. This means it is not possible to fill more wine in the cask  than the high of the shortest plank. The shortest plank in this case functions  as a metaphor for the limiting abiotic or biotic factor. </div><div>    Transferring  this concept to an ecosystem with multiple interacting stressors, this could  help to find a method for assessing multiple stressors and improve their  impacts and effects on marine ecosystems. Considering different ways of  classifying, grouping, quantifying and understanding stressors and the systems  they impact at various organizational levels, according to the Blackman’s  principle, there (probably) is a limiting factor. </div><div>    </div><div>In a  study of the Australian Institute of Marine Science it is mentioned, that in a  short time perspective, it could help to improve local stressors with an acute  impact in marine ecosystems, but in long term there is most likely a  stabilization of the ocean temperature needed to prevent the coral losses in  marine ecosystems, because, in this case, temperature as a stressor causes a  lot of other negative impacts and effects on the marine ecosystems. (De’ath <i>et al.</i>,  2012)  Thus, temperature would be the limiting factor or stressor. This means, even if  one, theoretically, improves all other stressors, in a long term perspective not  all changes in the ecosystem health could be prevented, due temperature rise  would still have a quite big impact on the condition of the ecosystem. </div><div>    </div><div>The  Blackman’s principle thus gives us a general idea on how to improve ecosystem  health and minimize the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in a long  term perspective by finding the limiting stressor, which is most likely the  rise of temperature.</div><div>    </div><div>So  all in all, the concept of ecosystem health could be useful to be able to  assess and predict how marine organisms and their ecosystems will adapt and  respond to different stressors acting in unison, and also which the most significant  or substantial ones are, so we can suggest a systematic framework of these  colossal changes to integrate the effects less universal stressors into.</div><div>    </div><div>            </div><div>    </div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_1">[TM1]</a>Citation missing</div><div>    </div><div>    </div><div>    </div><div>            </div>
