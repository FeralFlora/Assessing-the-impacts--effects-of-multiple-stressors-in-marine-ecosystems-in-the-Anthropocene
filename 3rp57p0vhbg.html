<div>&nbsp;Due to the amount of data that modelling can accept,  allowing for overlapping of variables, therefore multiple stressor impacts are able to be assessed simultaneously. Indicators used in modelling are relatively simple in themselves to be measured and the task of collecting the data to create the model is avoided with the use of large amounts of databases, making is cost-friendly.&nbsp;The sensitivity of models is improvable; some climate scenarios can be more sensitive than others to changes in stressors and their interactions. If the model is more sensitive to change, it can help with early warning signs, assisting in climate and environmental management. With the vast amount of models available, it is possible to find the most fitting or adaptable, relating to spatial and temporal scalings.</div><div></div>
