<h3 data-label="630511" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">3. Conceptual model of the ecosystem</h3><div>A conceptual model&nbsp;is key component in the development of an integrated monitoring program to assess trends in the ecologic status of a system, highlighting its most relevant elements and their interaction through network mapping.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{choat2011}</cite>&nbsp;give an example of such model, which shows how all the elements are related in the reef. By establishing an overview of the ecosystem functioning before the stressor inventory and ranking of the subsequent steps, this order should ensure an ecosystem based assessment, whereby stressor effects are seen as emergent phenomena in relation to the affected ecosystem&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite>.</div><div>Based on the understanding of the ecosystem structure and functioning derived from the ecosystem model, we can identify critical elements such as foundational and keystone species as well as indicator species, thus recognizing elements in the system that are best suited to promptly detect the onset and development of stress and ecosystem distress syndrome. In the case of the Great Barrier reef, corals are the obvious choice to indicate these changes, because their presence and structure underpins the entire ecosystem. It is also useful to recognize those species that thrive under certain conditions which will also cause an imbalance disrupting&nbsp;the ecosystem stability.&nbsp; As an example, in&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Cooper_2009}</cite>, a study with the purpose of undertaking a monitoring program to assess water quality on coral reefs,&nbsp;scientific literature was used to rank the suitability of bioindicators according to a framework that assessed weather responses to changes in water quality were&nbsp;<i>specific&nbsp;</i>(to the stressor of interest and not to other environmental stressors),&nbsp;<i>monotonic&nbsp;</i>(the magnitude of the biological response should reflect the intensity and duration of the stressor of interest), &nbsp;<i>variable</i> (biological responses should be consistent at a range of spatial and temporal scales), &nbsp;<i>practical&nbsp;</i>(measurements of biological responses should be cost effective, easy to measure, non-destructive and observer independent) and&nbsp;<i>relevant&nbsp;</i>(Biological response should be ecologically relevant and important in public perception to assist communication) to management goals for long- and short-term monitoring programmes. At the end of this process, 11 indicators were chosen for long-term&nbsp; and 8 for short-term monitoring useful to assess areas with acute disturbances on coral communities. The assessment framework developed in the article,  provides the basis for the selection of a suite of bioindicators to be used when assessing the consequences of changes in water quality around coral reefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
