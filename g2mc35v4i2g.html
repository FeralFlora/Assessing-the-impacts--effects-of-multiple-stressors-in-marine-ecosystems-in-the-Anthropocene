Discussion</h1><div>In our research question we are asking for assessment methods to evaluate the effects of multiple stressors impacting the marine ecosystem in the anthropocene. This research question was based on the hypotheses that various assessment methods for single stressors exist, but there are few approaches for multiple stressors assessments. Emphasizing the need for multivariate assessment methods to get a comprehensive insight into how multiple stressors can interact and affect the marine ecosystem, we started our literature review on setting a baseline for these assessments. Defining what  actually is understood by ecosystem health and describing how stressors can interact. We listed  tools and indicators which can be used in the assessment process to identify stressors and their potential interaction. Furthermore we established criteria that an ideal assessment method for multiple stressors should fulfill in order to be effective and comprehensive.</div><div> Moving on from this baseline we looked at various proposed assessment methods and case studies of marine health to get an overview of available assessment methods, including univariate, as well as multivariate methods. By this literature review, we were able to detect and separate several individual assessment methods, some more commonly used and recognized than other, more novel concepts. Based on the earlier established criteria, we evaluated these methods while taking into consideration the demands, availability of tools and background information that we acquired in the theory section in order to detect the strength, weaknesses and possible pitfalls of each method. Hence we came to the conclusion that a single method will not cover all the established methods sufficiently and consequently, a combination of methods is required to establish a holistic assessment method for multiple stressors. This conjunction of single methods, termed meta-methods, have as a matter of course already been taken into consideration in several studies. Analyzing and comparing the different steps of proposed meta-methods, we searched for similarities and generally consistent steps, which can be found in all meta-method approaches of multiple stressors assessments. As a result we created a merged meta-method including our own considerations and improvements. This meta-method, including nine different steps, is the attempt to find a holistic and extensive assessment methods for multiple stressors in the anthropocene.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="718390" class="ltx_title_subsection">Case study: </h2><div><b>1.
