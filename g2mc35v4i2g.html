Discussion</h1><div>Throughout this literature review, we've examined the clashes between the need for an increase in ecological realism in cumulative impact and effects assessments, and the ongoing, systematic biogeochemical and environmental changes being brought about in the Anthropocene. As these changes take ecosystem farther away from the states in which they haveve been scientifically described and scrutinized, practical reductionistic assumptions underlying our understanding of the structure and coherence of ecological networks (and the anthropogenic stressors affecting them) leave our estimates of human impacts halting dangerously behind reality. The conundrum arising from the paradoxically opposed but simultaneous needs of scientific clarity and simplicity, to transparently guide policy and management, and ecological realism, to sufficiently reflect the complex interactivity of ecosystems under stress from multiple stressors, threatens to leave our conservation efforts tragically sundered from the necessary stewardship in the Anthropocene. This report set out to find contemporary assessment methods that have bridged this gap and allowed for an adequate balance between ecological realism and practical simplicity.&nbsp;</div><div>We'll now discuss to which degree our recommended approach, with its basis in our literature review, aligns with these needs in the light of critical recommendations and considerations from other review articles and reports, and highlight the conditions that ensure the validity of the approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones_2016,Foley_2017,VanDenBrink2016,2017,Judd_2015}</cite></div><div>Furthermore, we will go into detail about the reasoning behind each step, as well as their relation to each other, and discuss the integrative opportunities of the combined methods, as well as describe some of the setback that the compromise of a tiered approach entails relative to an ideal, simple universal assessment method, yet achieved.</div><ul><li>P37 - C6 in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones2016}</cite> <b>Stressor based vs Effects based indicators</b></li><li>P45<b>&nbsp;Each step involves decisions and considerations</b></li><li>P48&nbsp;<b>Ecological Complexity precludes certainty</b></li><li>P53&nbsp;<b>Transparency and public participation facilitate rational decision-making</b></li><li>P88&nbsp;<b>Project-based assessments &lt; regional assessments</b></li><li>C11&nbsp;Basic knowledge about ecological stressors and effects is <b>rudimentary</b>. Nonetheless, numerical methods for quantifying, assessing, modeling, and predicting cumulative effects are well described.
