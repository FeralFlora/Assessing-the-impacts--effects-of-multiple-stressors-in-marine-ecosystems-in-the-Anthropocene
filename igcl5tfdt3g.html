<div>   The carbon cycle plays a very important role  on Earth and makes life possible. Carbon dioxide is the first component in food  chains and also acts as a climate regulator, providing to our planet a stable  temperature. When it forms carbonate ions, it behaves as an acidity buffer. It  also forms the skeleton of many marine organisms when carbonate is combined  with calcium.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Shields2005}</cite>&nbsp;The ocean is known to absorb 25% of the anthropogenic carbon  dioxide emissions - dissolved CO2&nbsp;concentration  increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2-, for that reason we can suggest that the carbon cycle is  controlled by the ocean.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Roy-Barman2016}</cite></div>
