<div>Without delving fully into the table and each criteria in relation to each method, at this stage, the application of the criteria has generally informed us that there is no single methodological approach in the reviewed literature that can sufficiently assess the effects of multiple stressors, taking into account the key considerations of a holistic ecosystem-based assessment approach. This finding is aligned with the complex and interdependent nature of marine ecosystems coupled with the diversity of impact pathways through the web of potentially non-additive and non-linear stressor interactions and impacts, as well as the multi-directional origin of effects, going not only from stressor to receptor, but arising instead from the multitude of interactions involved. This emphasizes the need to frame impacts not as intrinsic characteristics of stressors, but as emergent phenomenon that require an ecosystem based understanding. Thus, at the moment, there seems yet to be any single method which has unified and synthesized the necessary considerations and insights, although various approaches of modelling are moving in the direction of a unified approach (examples).&nbsp; From this finding</div><h2 data-label="678376" class="ltx_title_subsection">    </h2><h2 data-label="678376" class="ltx_title_subsection">Modelling</h2><div>Modelling can be complex in a way that it has the ability to input many variables and output a result which can be made into a diagram, a time-series, a thematic map,&nbsp;making teasily comparable with other observations and future predictions , making them very useful in the predictability category.</div><div>Models are very frequently used in combination with other types of methods.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2>Cumulative Impact Mapping </h2><div>The method Cumulative Impact Mapping may seem simple, its only need is to calculate the intensity of  each stressor, map the location of each habitat type and apply a vulnerability  weight (Halpern et al. 2007, Halpern et al. 2008b, Teck et al. 2010, Kappel et  al. 2012), but it requires to take into account many assumptions. These  assumptions, respectively, lead to some strengths and limitations that are  presented above.   &nbsp;</div><div>The first advantage of this method is its ability to demonstrate its  results in a simple and visualized way. This fact makes these maps a useful  tool for many education programs and also it is east to communicate the extent  of the problem to the community. Furthermore, the proposed framework can easily  be used and applied to local and regional scale assessment efforts, using a  more solid and integrated database(B. S. Halpern et al., 2008). </div><div>&nbsp;One of the first assumptions that scientists make in this method, in order  to combine stressors with variable distributions and different measurement  units, is to transform and normalize them. Additionally, as scientists have not  yet completely understood when, where or why non-additive responses  (synergistic and antagonistic) occur (Crain et al. 2008, Darling and Cote 2008)  they consider that cumulative stressor impacts are additive. The drawback of these  decisions is that the examined habitats will respond linearly to possible  changes. It is almost undoubtful, however, that such linear responses of  ecosystems to multiple stressors are the exception rather than the rule and  this could lead to insufficient results(Benjamin S. Halpern &amp; Fujita, 2013). Lastly, cumulative  impact mapping can rarely take into account historical references, even though  they are crucial to understanding how an area is affected by the various human  impacts on it.</div><h2>Impact Rating</h2><div>Impact rating is a rather simple, easily scalable method, where different criteria are used for ranking or rating the impacts and effects of the multiple stressors in the ecosystem. This is mostly happenning through an expert elicitation in form of a survey.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley_2017,Micheli_2013,Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>These methods are not always simple and cost-effective to collect, evaluate and rank, because you need a lot of data and expert opinions. Furthermore, the expert elicition has a high possibility to be biased. Therefore, also the possibilityof applying the method&nbsp; to other locations and studies, giving reliable information about the examined ecosystem, depends on the sufficienty of the data. This makes it difficult to provide early warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple stressors over time and to&nbsp;provide a future envision on possible interactions between the multile stresssors and ecosystem's degratation.</div><div>So all in all, the impact rating often rather goes together with other methods, such as modelling or indexes, to&nbsp;display the change of interest and provide sufficient results for the whole ecosystem in a scale or rating system, than being communicated as a single method.</div><h2>Indexes</h2><div> Indexes represent scientific results in a simple, numerical way and thereby give an general general overview of the assessment results. This gives the method&nbsp;of indexes the ability to display a rather complex investigation in an clear way. Due to that indicators seem to be useful as a baseline which indicate a focus and can be related to in further studies. At the same time this simple approach can also be too facile or vacuous since it only gives a number as outcome. Without looking at the evaluation how this number was constructed or an explanation which are the causes for this outcome, one might not understand the exact statement and validity of the index, especially if it is a highly complex index. Therefore the communicabilty, especially to laypeople, which represent the broader audience, is decreasing in value or remains rather trivial. Combing the index with a further method such as mapping could benefit the communicability. Indexes being a mathematical contruct of various variables are fairly sensitive and reactive to changes, due to the fact that a change of number of one variable directly effects the calculation. However the effectivesness of the index remains dependant on the individual index. The Ocean Health Index, which has already been mentioned earlier in the paper is a quite comprehensive index to illustrate ocean health. But this broad spectrum of evaluation also gives the possibilty of lack of data, hence the measureabilty as well as the sensitivity of the index declines.</div><h2 data-label="281562" class="ltx_title_subsection">                             &nbsp;</h2><div><table>   <tbody><tr>    <td>    <div><b>1</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Problem formulation and the purpose of the    assessment</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>What first needs to be done is to formulate the problem, what    includes setting the protection goals, the risk assessment objectives and    important ecological considerations.</div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div><b>2</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Define baseline</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Defining which are the reference points of interest is one of    the first steps that scientist should take.Setting clear historical baselines    is essential in examining degraded ecosystems to diminish the risk of    imprecise assumptions and provide a solid base for future comparisons. </div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div><b>3</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Conceptual model of ecosystem (focus on elements    and processes)</b></div>    <div><b>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    </b><b>identify bio-ecological receptors and    their relationships</b></div>    <div><b>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    </b><b>Relate the model to the concept of    ecosystem health</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>After finding the potential receptors, the ecosystem is    represented in a conceptual framework focusing on the receptors, their    interactions and the ecological processes.
