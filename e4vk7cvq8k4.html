<div>Without delving fully into the table and each criteria in relation to each method, at this stage, the application of the criteria has generally informed us that there is no single methodological approach in the reviewed literature that can sufficiently assess the effects of multiple stressors, taking into account the key considerations of a holistic ecosystem-based assessment approach. This finding is aligned with the complex and interdependent nature of marine ecosystems coupled with the diversity of impact pathways through the web of potentially non-additive and non-linear stressor interactions and impacts, as well as the multi-directional origin of effects, going not only from stressor to receptor, but arising instead from the multitude of interactions involved. This emphasizes the need to frame impacts not as intrinsic characteristics of stressors, but as emergent phenomenon that require an ecosystem based understanding. Thus, at the moment, there seems yet to be any single method which has unified and synthesized the necessary considerations and insights, although various approaches of modelling are moving in the direction of a holistic assessments&nbsp;<b>(examples)</b>.&nbsp; Therefore, the necessary approach seems to be a tiered combination of the various methods in a logical stepwise progression process, each step building upon the previous steps in a way that utilizes the advantages and eliminates the pitfalls of the combined methods by applying them for use within their capabilities. This approach is in line with the recommendations of the literature reviews and articles highlighted in section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{488223}</span>, where such tiered approaches are recommended.</div><div>We base our own tiered methodological approach on these recommendations, analyzing which steps are universally recommended as well as looking at the novelties or discrepancies, to evaluate whether these discrepancies ought to universally recommended or instead could be left out.

Modelling can be complex yet useful in that it has the ability to input many variables and then output a result which can be made into a diagram, a time-series, or a thematic map. Thus, making models easily comparable with other observations and future predictions as well as easing the task of visualizing changes.&nbsp;</div>
