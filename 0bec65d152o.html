The ocean will react transforming the  bicarbonate into carbonate realising hydrogen ions to stabilize it.     <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Webber1991}</cite></div><div> </div><div>Great Barrier Reef, Climate Change, communities, compositional data, coral reef dynamics; human impacts; local threat; long-term behavior; ocean temperature; reef state; stochastic model</div>
