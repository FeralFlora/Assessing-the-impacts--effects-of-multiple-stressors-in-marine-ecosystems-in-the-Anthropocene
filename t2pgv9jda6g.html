</h2><div>                               &nbsp;</div><div>“Over the past 50 years,  humans have changed the world’s ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in  any other comparable period in human history.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>  But how does that apply tomarine ecosystems? Around 70 percent of the earth surface  is covered by water, and the ocean represents 99 percent of earths habitats, this leads to the  assumption, that marine ecosystem play a major role, concerning the health  status of earths ecosystem.&nbsp;</div><div>It’s argued that the scope of human  activity has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level that our  impacts on the biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark  history on a geological timescale. In this new epoch, the Anthropocene, humans  have arguably become the main driver of change in the environment.&nbsp;</div><div>    The word ‘Anthropocene’ was  first used by the researcher Paul J. Crutzen in 2002 as assigning the term  ‘Anthropocene’ to                                     our current, mainly human influenced period  following the Holocene. Different authors already  used similar words before, such as Antonia Stoppani in 1873 speaking about a                                     new kind of influence on earth comparable to  natural influences and V. I. Vernadsky describing the growing impact of humans as  an evolutionary process on earth. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crutzen_2002}</cite>         </div><div>&nbsp;The Anthropocene began with the  industrialization and James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. The  humans started to expand their use of fossil oils and their CO2 emissions.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007,Crutzen_2002}</cite>&nbsp;It is suggested, that the current human impact last for long periods.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    The researchers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Steffen_2007}</cite>&nbsp;are stating that the Anthropocene proceeded in three  different stages. Starting with Pre-Anthropocene events, including the first  major use of fossil fuels, leading to the first stage of the Anthropocene: The  Industrial Era. This stage, mainly described by the industrialization, started  around 1800 and ended around 1945 with the second World War. During this era  humans energy source was massively altered by the expansion of the use of oil,  gas and coil in industry. During the period of time from 1800 until 2000,  humans energy used grew about 40-fold and global economy increased about  50-fold. Related to this, human population registered enormous growth in  numbers. Looking at the impact of the Industrial era on the biosphere by  comparing the                                     CO<sub>2</sub>         concentration in the atmosphere, the preindustrial era  accounted an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration about 270-275 ppmv and rose above  300 ppmv until 1950. By the end of the second stage of the Anthropocene, the  Great acceleration, around 2015, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has  increased above 380 ppmv. This extreme rise in numbers is only a small fragment  of the ecological change that happened during the industrial era and the Great  acceleration, but gives a good insight in the scope of the interference.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    During the second stage of  the Anthropocene, humans population has grown over 6 billion, the global  economy experienced a great extension, motorization proceeded and urban areas  expanded drastically. This stating only a few aspects of this era characterized  by expansion, innovation and discovery.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>                                           Humans have shaped and effected the marine  ecosystem, rising more and more with human development. For example about 8% of  the primary production of the oceans is used by humans, while that fraction  grows for areas to more than 25% and for temperate continental shelf systems to  more than one third. Furthermore, by 1995 one fifth of known marine fisheries  were overexploided or already exhausted and 44% were at a critical threshold.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite> This shows the great interference of humankind on the marine ecosystem,  especially marine life.</div><div>    Since 2015, we  have entered the third stage of the Anthropocene, named 'Stewards of the Earth  System'.  Given by the name of this era, now-a-days humans are seen as major geological  force, &nbsp;shaping the future of the earth system. This stage is described by growing  awareness, due to more research, global information-flow, more stable and democratic  governments, integration into policies concerns and social and cultural  concerns.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Our current  extraction-consumption based economic&nbsp;model has led to rapid expansion of human  habitation and resource extraction causing detrimental effects on the extent  and integrity of the ecosystems and habitats that enable rich biodiversity and  vital ecosystem services. Furthermore, the resources we extract are often  returned to the environment in such a composition or context that they become  pollutants, which no longer cycle through the systems in an equilibrium or a  beneficial way. Going forward, human activity is likely to cause widespread  mass-extinctions and biodiversity loss with adverse consequences for future  habitability on earth, should we stay on a business as usual course without  altering our ways. Referring to the article “The future of biodiversity”,  currently the Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of  species loss growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm_1995}</cite>. The atmospheric concentrations of several important greenhouse gases have  increased substantially. As a result the Earth is warming rapidly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014}</cite> and more nitrogen is now  converted from the atmosphere into reactive forms by fertilizer production and  fossil fuel combustion compared to all of the natural processes in terrestrial  ecosystems put together.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Galloway_2002}</cite></div><div>    Most of the human-induced  stress on marine ecosystems can be ascribed to climate change. Climate change  being one of the major and most discussed catchphrases in our time, shows that  “(..) the recognition that human activities are indeed affecting the structure  and functioning of the Earth System (..) is filtering through to  decision-making at many levels”.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Human activities have had a  significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems; especially in marine ecosystems.  For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source of food and  a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we do. But in  the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the ocean has  limits and that in many important parts of our seas the sustainability  thresholds have been breached.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite>                                     &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{riebesell2017}</cite>&nbsp;describes this impact by defining  the Anthropocene in “Ocean change: a mix of interacting stressors” as an age in  which humans impact the environment and Earths’ ecosystems to the same amount  or even more than natural influences. Furthermore, he emphasizes marine  ecosystems in this era while describing ocean change as an ongoing process in  the whole history of earth and that the present ocean change be unique in the  modern time. It be the fastest change and perhaps the biggest influence, that a  single species ever had and that species be modern humans – us.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{riebesell2017}</cite></div><div>                                            For this  reason there is a need to understand the ongoing processes of ocean change and  the changes in marine ecosystems and their health.</div><div>         &nbsp;</div><div><b>Defining Marine Ecosystem Health</b></div><h3 data-label="340009" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The Importance of Understanding Marine Ecosystems and their Interactions</h3><div> The marine ecosystem is an important biological system that provides services to humanity as a whole and therefore we  are a&nbsp;beneficiary of the ocean for what it provides, but research  is stressing the urgency for environmental management of this ecosystem due to  the rapidness of its declining state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>So how do we protect the biological systems that has evolved &nbsp;into the foundation of sustaining life on Earth?</div><div>First of all, organisms are organized in  different&nbsp;trophic levels according  to their feeding relationships.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Trites2001}</cite> The energy in the  ocean is transferred by photoautotrophic organisms, or&nbsp;primary producers, placed in the first trophic level to  herbivores, or&nbsp;primary consumers, that  form the second trophic level.
