By creating a new  stable state or returning to conditions of the original one, stress would be  removed from the system.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></div><div>    Moreover, different stressors acting  together may have distinct impacts than a single one, resulting in non-linear  effects. Their impacts are determined by their strength, duration, and timing,  as well as by the proprieties of the receptor.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></div><h2 data-label="348089" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="348089" class="ltx_title_subsection">Marine Stressors and their interaction</h2><div>The purpose of this chapter is to give an explanation of the different stressors and their effects of the marine ecosystem and their interactions.</div>
