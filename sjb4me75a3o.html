One method of calculating the quantity of  net photosynthetic production is estimating the rate of change in O2  production or CO2 consumption.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sumich2016}</cite> Moreover, its  distribution in the ocean shows the nutrient stock.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Chavez2010}</cite></div><h3 data-label="824515" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">  Carbon  cycle</h3><div>    The carbon cycle plays a very important role  on Earth and makes life possible. Carbon dioxide is the first component in food  chains and also acts as a climate regulator, providing to our planet a stable  temperature. When it forms carbonate ions, it behaves as an acidity buffer. It  also forms the skeleton of many marine organisms when carbonate is combined  with calcium.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Shields2005}</cite>&nbsp;The ocean is known to absorb 25% of the anthropogenic carbon  dioxide emissions - dissolved CO2&nbsp;concentration  increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2-, for that reason we can suggest that the carbon cycle is  controlled by the ocean.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Roy-Barman2016}</cite></div><div>  Firstly, carbon is absorbed by  phytoplankton and it forms organic compounds. Afterwards, these compounds are  discomposed to carbon dioxide through respiration or autolytic breakdown.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Webber1991}</cite></div><div> Furthermore, the carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere is dissolved in the ocean. It reacts with water and form carbonic  acid. This instable molecule will split into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate.  Then, the bicarbonate will react with calcium carbonate causing its  precipitation.    <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Webber1991}</cite>    </div><div>  Therefore, marine primary production and the  carbon cycle are closely related because if too much carbon dioxide is absorbed  by phytoplankton, ph will increase. The ocean will react transforming the  bicarbonate into carbonate realising hydrogen ions to stabilize it.     <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Webber1991}</cite>    </div><h3 data-label="995732" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Stressor</h3><div>    Stressor is defined as “any external  abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its normal  operating range”.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></div><div>    It is important to differentiate the  concepts: stressor, stress, and stress response. <b>Stressor</b> is an external factor; <b>stress</b> is an internal state created by a stressor, and <b>stress response</b> is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{StraalenN.M.2003}</cite></div><div>    Additionally, stress response entails  adaptive mechanisms that cost energy from biological systems. By creating a new  stable state or returning to conditions of the original one, stress would be  removed from the system.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></div><div>    Moreover, different stressors acting  together may have distinct impacts than a single one, resulting in non-linear  effects. Their impacts are determined by their strength, duration, and timing,  as well as by the proprieties of the receptor.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></div><h2 data-label="348089" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="348089" class="ltx_title_subsection">Marine Stressors and their interaction</h2><div>The purpose of this chapter is to give an explanation of the different stressors and their effects of the marine ecosystem and their interactions.</div>
