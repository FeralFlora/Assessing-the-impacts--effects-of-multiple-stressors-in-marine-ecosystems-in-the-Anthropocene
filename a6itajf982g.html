However, a more acidic environment will harm other marine species such as molluscs, corals and some varieties of plankton. The shells and skeletons of these animals may become less dense or strong. In the case of coral reefs this may make them more vulnerable to dissolution storm damage and slow the recovery rate.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haigh2015}</cite></div>
