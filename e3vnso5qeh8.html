<h3 data-label="269095" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Interaction between stressors</h3><div>While interactions between stressor are highly complex to measure the prevailing view is that in a situation where three or more stressors (e.g. ocean warming, OA, overfishing) are affecting the ecosystem, synergies are expected to be the most prevalent interaction type.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Paine1998}</cite>&nbsp;On other hand some interaction might also experience an&nbsp;antagonistic (reduced stress) or&nbsp; additive (no additional stress) effects. When a system is affected by multiple stressors it also  diminishes its resilience and recovery giving space increasing vulnerability towards disturbances that would generally not have any affect on an healthy ecosystem (Beaugrand et al. 2010).</div>
