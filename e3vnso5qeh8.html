As the preceding sections have shown, the challenges of effectively and accurately assessing and predicting the outcomes of multiple stressors acting in parallel on marine ecosystems lie in the inherent complexity of the task - arising both from the interwoven nature of ecosystems with webbed relationships of direct and&nbsp; indirect interdependence, as well as the overlapping and interacting effects of the stressors themselves.&nbsp;</div><div>The ecosystems affected by multiple stressors can not be assumed to be in any one stable state, when assessed long-term or even inter-annually, as the ongoing effects of human impacts and systemic alterations to the biosphere continue to develop in magnitude, multitude and spatial extent, thus forcing future assessment and management efforts to take on a more holistic, dynamic and earth-system / ecologically insightful approach to avoid non-linear effects and resultant ecological surprises, which might otherwise thwart the  efforts to stave of the ongoing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ceballos_2015}</cite> (or conservatively, impending&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rothman_2017}</cite>) Sixth Mass Extinction. As a result, given the multivariate nature and complexity of the issue, univariate impact assessments may well be rendered effectively obsolete in most future oceanic contexts, except when conducted as part of  systemic analyses.</div><div>Paradoxically, there is simultaneously a need to pay greater attention to specific characteristics of stressors, biological receptors and their physical environments and the dynamics and interactions between these, and a need to simplify these complexities in a way that allows for effective analysis in an timely manner, balancing holism and information overload. The latter need is underlined by the urgency of the biodiversity and ecosystem stability crisis.</div><div>We'll now consider the conventional approaches to impact assessments - mainly ecotoxicology - and highlight some of their strengths as well as the pitfalls that have inspired the efforts to develop new approaches, both in extension of the existing methods and in novel ways&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanStraalen2003}</cite>. Thereafter, we'll give a rough outline of general themes in&nbsp;multiple stressor assessments, which are expanded upon in section&nbsp;<b>(insert section)</b> of the report.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="218717" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conventional ecological risk and impact assessments and their pitfalls&nbsp;</h2><div>Ecotoxicology,&nbsp;"the branch of Toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by  natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human),  vegetable and microbial, in an integral context”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Truhaut1977}</cite>, developed from toxicology's initial focus on the dose-response of individuals within test populations to chemicals into a similar measure for ecological toxicity, where a concentration of a chemical in an environment amounts to a certain degree of toxicity concluding with an ecological risk assessment. Viewed as an attempt at an integration of ecology and toxicology,&nbsp; ecotoxicology has been criticized for being too simplistic - leaning more towards toxicology than ecology and failing to account sufficiently for the categorical difference between an individual and communities, where population size and constitution are deciding factors, rather than the response mode of an individual.</div><blockquote><div>Although research in ecotoxicology has progressed substantially from simplified, single-species laboratory tests, the ecotoxicological data that provide the scientific input to risk assessments are based primarily on such simple tests.</div></blockquote><div>   <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Calow2003}</cite>    </div><div>To extrapolate from these simplified single-species laboratory tests to complex ecosystems, two conceptual approaches are generally applied:</div><ol><li>PNECs (Predicted No Effect Concentrations)</li><li>SSDs (Species Sensitivity Distributions)</li></ol><div>PNECs are thresholds that assign the upper concentration limit until which ecological effects remaining unlikely. SSDs are applications of available critical response data such as NOEC (No-Observed-Effect Concentrations) or EC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;(sublethal response in 50% of the population)<sub>&nbsp;</sub>information, from either prospective or retrospective risk assessments, as a function of chemical concentrations to derive a frequency distribution of affected species. When SSDs are applied, they are used to inform about a concentration that will leave a large fraction (90–95%) of the affected species above the critical-effect threshold, which is interpreted as allowing the continued integrity of intact ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Calow2003}</cite>. As "intact ecosystems" may be in short order today, this assumption may be increasingly unrealistic / optimistic.</div><div>As noted by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Segner2014}</cite> "This approach neglects the fact that toxic chemicals in the environment do not act in isolation, but their impact on biota is modulated by the presence of other biotic and abiotic stressors." Therein lies the major pitfall of the current ecotoxilogical approaches to risk and impact assessments, and the crux of the multiple stressor challenge.</div><div>The challenge is aggravated by changing&nbsp;    environmental conditions     and their increasing variability, brought about by widespread human impacts, as explored in section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384501}</span>, with overlapping stressors in most if not all cases.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gutt2015a}</cite> In specific cases, stressors in localized environments have numbered as high as 23 stressors, with an average of 13 stressors in each location,     specifically in this case along the California Current in the Pacific Ocean&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern_2009}</cite>. This change in environmental conditions, referring to both biochemical and physical characteristics of the marine environment, alters the operation of pollutants with effects on transport, transformation and distribution of these, whilst also altering behavior of native and potential invasive species to disrupt ecosystem composition, species distributions and their habitats&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Couillard2008}</cite>. Furthermore, this change in environmental conditions can affect the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals (or xenobiotics, for a more encompassing term)&nbsp; and in turn these may affect aquatic species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and stress&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Couillard2008a,Hooper2013}</cite>, leading to more unpredictable results and otherwise unexpected outcomes and ecological surprises&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Paine1998,Christensen2006}</cite>. Most notably and worrying, these interactions, as described in&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{269095}</span>, can be non-additive, leading to non-linear synergistic effects, which may nudge the state of ecosystems towards (often yet identified) critical thresholds for ecosystem functioning&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Groffman2006}</cite>, although stressor interactions can also be antagonistic&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Porter1999,Crain2008}</cite>. A review by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Crain2008}</cite> found that the addition of a third stressor (in 171 studies where two or more stressors were manipulated in coastal and marine systems) doubled the number of synergistic effects, suggesting that these types of interactions are prominent in nature, where multiple anthropogenic stressors have become the norm in the Anthropocene&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2007}</cite>, again demonstrating the limited applicability of isolated or limited  stressor studies.</div><div>Constituent stressors in multiple stressors contexts vary in spatial and temporal extent, intensity, frequency and other factors. Similarly, the biological responses these stressors induce and provoke, both directly at an organismal level and indirectly at ecosystem levels, depend on the characteristics of the biological receptors and their environments, both of which are not static, but vary temporally as a function of environmental change, natural variability, life history, community composition etc <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Floder2012}</cite>. Most importantly, there is a divergence between global or systemic stressors (e.g. geophysical change) and local or regional stressors (e.g. chemical stressors) in terms of duration and intensity. Identifying supposedly intrinsic chemical stressor characteristics from controlled laboratory conditions mostly provides insight into acute dose-responses, but as we've discussed, the environmental conditions under which these impacts and interactions occur are undergoing ongoing long-term systemic changes - which are    themselves     severe stressors  - the end result of which largely depends on how far we'll take the full scale planetary experiment now named the Anthropocene. Thus, these conventional approaches to ecological impact and risk assessments are quite futile as a foundation for multiple stressor assessments under current and future conditions.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></div><div>This is not to say that ecotoxicology has become obsolete. Rather, in multiple stressor contexts, it suffers from its origins (the "eco-" prefix being a later adaptation) so as to require significant refinement to sufficiently account for the interdependent and changing state of the ecosystems within which the stressor impacts, it assesses, occur. Although these needed improvements are acknowledged and are being addressed&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Calow2003}</cite>, this project  focuses on assessment methods conceived from an ecosystem based approach, which we hope will circumvent or at least account for the pitfalls and assumptions discussed above and in the immediate section.</div><div>Write about: ADVERSE OUTCOME PATHWAYS&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hooper_2012}</cite></div><div>Before we move on to a short discussion of the main underlying assumptions that impair  realistic insights into the full extent of multiple stressor impacts, we'll have a look at a preliminary approach to cumulative impact assessments, namely cumulative impact mapping.</div><div>Whilst the details vary, cumulative impact mapping involves identifying the stressors impacting the region to be mapped or assessed, ranking the stressors based on their severity in relation to the main vulnerabilities of the particular ecosystem or ecosystem component, estimating the stressor impacts' spatial range and, based on the overlapping stressor ranges, estimating the cumulative stress impacts, sometimes expressed as a numerical cumulative impact score. This approach is very helpful in estimating the general level of cumulative impacts in specific regions (or even the global oceans) and it informs us about the areas in the greatest need of management and conservation and mitigation efforts, even providing insights into the most significant single stressors or general driver categories&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2009}</cite>. But whilst this approach provides the aforementioned general insights, which are of course very valuable, it doesn't inform  about the specific potential inter-stressor dynamics, since additivity and linearity are assumed in impact sums and stress level / stress response relationships, respectively, although synergism and non-linearity should  rather be&nbsp;assumed to be almost ubiquitous as a precautionary measure&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008,Hunsicker2016}</cite>. Therefore such cumulative impact maps, when considered in isolation as policy instruments, may prove to be overly conservative estimates of the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors.</div><h3 data-label="887736" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Underlying assumptions and simplifications</h3><div>Two main assumptions, whether intentionally assumed or not, tend to underlie impact assessments - even, albeit to a lesser degree - cumulative impact and risk assessments; these are same assumptions as highlighted above, namely&nbsp;that of an additive impact sum&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2017}</cite> and a linear relationship between the stress level and the stress response&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hunsicker2016}</cite>, which is especially uncertain in a multiple stressor context, which encompasses most, and in the future, likely all marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2008,Gutt2015a}</cite>.</div><div>As previously stressed, the answer to the intricacies of multiple stressor assessments isn't just taking as many variables and confounding factors into consideration as possible, because, although this approach might be desirable if it were conceivable in practice, the truth remains that all human insights are ultimately approximations of reality, as necessitated by our limited ability to synthesize all the information available to us. Furthermore, this ideal is even farther from our reach, because the necessary information is simply unknown in many cases, either because of a lack of data or a lack of understanding. Given these limitations, we must strive to accurately describe the important dynamics that characterize multiple stressors impacts in ecosystem contexts and eliminate uncertainties in a balancing act between accuracy and practicality or ease of assessment. Finding this midpoint between accuracy and practicality involves compromise and extrapolation, so assuming additivity and linearity can be forgiven as a preliminary approach to overcome debilitating complexities. But to leave it at that and not pursue a greater understanding of potential inter-stressor dynamics would leave critical ecosystems, and subsequently human communities, vulnerable to severe compound impacts we've yet to identify or understand. So, ultimately,&nbsp;reliable multiple stressor impact assessments must overcome the assumptions of additivity and linearity.</div><h2>  &nbsp;</h2><h2 data-label="273940" class="ltx_title_subsection">Themes in multiple stressor assessments</h2><div>The challenges of multiple stressor assessments largely arise from or relate to the vast amounts of data involved, from across several related but separate fields with varying focuses along with separate terminologies and methodologies. Thus, synthesis challenges are prominent, and a key aspect of overcoming these challenges lies in improving reproducibility, consistency and the ease of collaboration. To do so, researchers working on the Ocean Health Index project applied principles and software from data science, specifically tools that enable collaborative<i> open data science</i>, defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hampton2015}</cite> as: "the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers" to better their scientific computing and oversee the necessary complexity of environmental science.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2017}</cite>&nbsp;Going deeper into the specifics of the methodologies recommended by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lowndes2017}</cite> is not within the scope of this project, but the developments within ecology and other environmental towards assimilation of methodologies derived from data science in general are important trends that facilitate the shift from reductionistic to holistic science. At the same time, the application of these data science methodologies might enable environmental researchers to conduct better, more reproducible (and thus trustworthy) science in less time, which is imperative since time is of the essence in matters of understanding, communicating and acting on our understanding of the ecological issues in the Anthropocene, and how they relate to societal matters. Effective public communication of these matters  has been emphasized by ecologists, witnessing the all-encompassing&nbsp;extent of human impacts, for decades,  advocating for greater interdisciplinary science, and stressing that "Ecology is a discipline with a time limit, because much of what we study, upon which society is dependent, is fast disappearing."&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bazzaz}</cite></div><h3 data-label="326080" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h3 data-label="326080" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Ecosystem based approach</h3><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="848109" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multivariate vs. univariate assessments
</h2><div>                                         With ecosystems  affected by multiple stressors with growing individual and cumulative impacts,  there is a greater likelihood of non-linear ecological surprises, which are  hard to predict and may cause change past thresholds of transition from one  ecological state to another. So we need to understand and account for the  cumulative effects of multiple stressors to get a holistic and representative  view on the consequences of human activities upon the natural systems that  constitute our home and the basis of society. Counter to this need, science  tends to be practiced too narrowly, allowing great insight into specifics  without necessarily providing an adequate view of the full picture. Moreover,  we need to be able to assess and predict how marine organisms and their  ecosystems will adapt and respond to different stressors acting in unison, to  make reasonable predictions for the future development of these ecosystems.&nbsp;</div><div>    Multivariate  stressors deal with more than one variable. An example of these models is the practice  of cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM), a method of modifying  existing tools for univariate stressors, such as environmental impact  assessment (EIA), for specific valued ecosystem components (VECs) for the use  of CEAM. This method tries to assess cumulative effects for multiple actions  using the tools of “encompass indicators, environmental indices, and habitat  suitability models bases on pertinent indices” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Canter_2011}</cite>. Thus indicators and indices, dealing with only one  variable or metric, are used for environmental studies creating an index or  modelling. Assessing multivariate effects, one can see the potential adaption  of these EIA tools for the usage in CEAM. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Canter_2011}</cite></div><div>    So the often found too narrowly research of  scientists, concentrating only on one or a few stressor(s), gives us a great  detailed knowledge about their used tools. Furthermore, they make specific  predictions about future perspectives of ecosystem adaptions. Using this  knowledge and modifying the tools for assessing these univariate stressors to  assess multivariate stressors, one can get a realistic picture of the  cumulative effects and the different stressors interacting to make reasonable  predictions for the future development of these ecosystems.</div><div>            </div><h2>Overview of approaches to multiple stressor impact assessments</h2><div>@Stephanie</div><h3>Characteristics of the methods</h3><div>    </div>
