Discussion</h1><div>Throughout this literature review, we've examined the clashes between the need for an increase in ecological realism in cumulative impact and effects assessments, and the ongoing, systematic biogeochemical and environmental changes being brought about in the Anthropocene. As these changes take ecosystem farther away from the states in which they have been scientifically described and scrutinized, practical reductionistic assumptions underlying our understanding of the structure and coherence of ecological networks (and the anthropogenic stressors affecting them) leave our estimates of human impacts halting dangerously behind reality. The conundrum arising from the paradoxically opposed but simultaneous needs of scientific clarity and simplicity, to transparently guide policy and management, and ecological realism, to sufficiently reflect the complex interactivity of ecosystems under stress from multiple stressors, threatens to leave our conservation efforts tragically sundered from the necessary biosphere stewardship in the Anthropocene. This report sets out to find contemporary assessment methods that have bridged this gap and allowed for an adequate balance between ecological realism and practical simplicity.&nbsp;</div><div>We'll now discuss to which degree our recommended approach, with its basis in our literature review, aligns with these needs in the light of critical recommendations and considerations from other review articles and reports, and highlight the conditions that ensure the validity of the approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones_2016,Foley_2017,VanDenBrink2016,2017,Judd_2015}</cite></div><div>Furthermore, we will go into detail about the reasoning behind each step, as well as their relation to each other, and discuss the integrative opportunities of the combined methods, as well as describe some of the setback that the compromise of a tiered approach entails relative to an ideal, simple universal assessment method, yet achieved.</div><div>Our proposed tiered multiple stressor assessment approach aims to meet the criteria we judged the reviewed assessment approaches by. Specifically, we aimed for the approach to be transferable to a diverse range of marine ecosystems at various locations, spatially scalable to assess impacts with different extents to facilitate assessment focuses at different scales; the indicators and proxies used as representations of the ecological elements, processes and conditions that constitute marine ecosystem health, as defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Tett2013}</cite>, should be sufficiently simple and cost-effective to measure and evaluate, whilst being sensitive enough to enable early detection of change and impact, thus providing the assessment process with the ability to detect potential inter-stressor and cascading ecological effects and dynamic processes. Detection is an important first step, but responding effectively requires pairing the knowledge of an issue to an actionable understanding of it. The best case would therefore be if the information, the assessment approach produced, could provide (preferably ecological and mechanistic) insights, which avoid the assumptions of additivity and linearity, to enable predictive assessment capabilities. Finally, the assessment process should maintain transparency and toe the line of complexity in a balance that provides the aforementioned insights without alienating the public and other stakeholders for which the assessment is relevant, both environmentally and culturally. That is, the method should accommodate effective communication of the issues addressed through both the assessment process and results.</div><div>Some of the above criteria are met by generic nature of the assessment process we propose. As an assessment framework, the tiered approach embodies key aspects of ecological realism and scientific holism by incorporating these considerations into the structure of the assessment. We adapt&nbsp;the key point of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Segner2014}</cite>, framing stressor impacts from the receptor's perspective, by establishing the conceptual ecosystem model to identify key ecosystem elements, relationships and processes before identification and ranking the present stressors. The latter steps are then performed in relation to the former to anchor the assessment as ecosystem based&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Wrona1996}</cite>, cementing the cumulative nature of stressor impacts as a fundamental assessment principle&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sinclair2017}</cite>.</div><div>Whilst some considerations are cooked into the tiered approach, its steps and their order, other critical considerations depend on the methods applied in each step. Because of the generalized nature of the assessment process, it also allows considerable malleability to accommodate transferability and scalability to diverse contexts and scale, since the methods appropriated to each step are chosen for their universal applicability, and if such universality cannot be achieved, one must rely on a diversity of regionally developed methods to bridge these gaps to any particular context. That is to say, as previously emphasized, that our recommended approach will not fit any context right "out-of-the-box", but can instead be adapted to most contexts to ensure that the embodied considerations are upheld through the structure of the assessment. Whilst this is valuable in itself, the results of the assessment process will ultimately depend on the ability of the appropriate methods to achieve the aims of each step. This is especially important for the ninth step of integration and quantification, which concludes the assessment. Therefore, we will now delve deeper into these methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>setbacks of tiered approach</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>P37 - C6 in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones2016}</cite> <b>Stressor based vs Effects based indicators</b></li><li>P45<b>&nbsp;Each step involves decisions and considerations</b></li><li>P48&nbsp;<b>Ecological Complexity precludes certainty</b></li><li>P53&nbsp;<b>Transparency and public participation facilitate rational decision-making</b></li><li>P88&nbsp;<b>Project-based assessments &lt; regional assessments</b></li><li>C11&nbsp;Basic knowledge about ecological stressors and effects is <b>rudimentary</b>. Nonetheless, numerical methods for quantifying, assessing, modelling, and predicting cumulative effects are well described.

are relatively well described, but the required monitoring data are generally lacking (Dammanet al. 1995; Scherer 2011; Schultz 2012; Ball et al. 2013; Venier et al. 2014), and are “expensive and time consuming to gather” (Connelly 2011). Obviously, more complex models call for more complex input datasets and underlying monitoring programs, so a vicious cycle is apparent (Gallagher et al. 2015). The information that is available is “highly uncertain and variable in quality” (Karkkainen 2002), and is, for the most part, not efficiently shared among CEA participants (Damman et al. 1995).</i></li></ul><div></div><h3 data-label="212698" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> Challenges (in assessing the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene)</h3><h3 data-label="212698" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><div>Assessing the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems itself is one of the biggest challenges in science.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite>&nbsp;But why is this assessment that challenging?&nbsp;Trying to make a&nbsp;holistic or ecosystem-based perspective is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses. This is due to the complexity of the topic and a huge lack of data, such as the still only partly understood interactions among multiple stressors in marine ecosystems. Therefore, considerable future reseacrh is needed to&nbsp;improve the contribution these system models make to understand interactions among multiple stressors.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></div><div>Fundamental questions in this research section are, whether the&nbsp;expected joint effect of a cumulative impact and effect is higher or lower than the intensity of each single stressor. Moreover,&nbsp;it is critical to assess whether the various stressors are overlapping in time and space to result in a potential cumulative effect. Additional, the recovery potential of an ecosystem might be important to differenciate between multi- and univariate stressors' impacts. Another problem in relation to the aforementioned balancing act between accuracy and practicality is the lack of consistency or standardisation in approaches, definitions and vocabulary of cumulative imppacts assessment. This lack of clarity leads to a recommendation of looking criticalon defining the scope of the assessment and the best fitting methodologies. As one can see before, the recommended steps of assessing multiple stressors are a mixture of different methods, collecting the best fitting methodologies. Although there still exist various definitions of how to describe cumulative impact asessment, one can say, that all cumulative effect assessments are based on an ecosystem approach. &nbsp;This need for the development of an ecosystem based approach to the assessment of cumulative impacts from multiple stressors has been recognized and emphasized for decades&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Wrona1996}</cite>. Therefore, it is important</div><div>Wrone et. al pointed out the following key traits of ecosystem based environmental assessments: 1. an emphasis on the collection and synthesis of integrated knowledge of ecosystem structure and function; 2. a&nbsp;holistic perspective, interrelating systems at different organizational, spatial and temporal scales within the ecosystem; and 3. an attempt to develop management strategies that are ecological, anticipatory and ethical.&nbsp;<b>(Christie et al., 1986)</b></div>
