<div></div><h3>Facing the Challenges of Defining Marine Ecosystem Health</h3><div>Suggested is an application of a human health metaphor which can help us to  assess the dilemmas in which we will face when understanding ecosystem health; there are three fundamental issues which are proposed: recognizing the absence of objective criteria for assessing health indicators, recognizing when changes are actual or a false alarm, and the quest to find classifying indicators with attributes of being holistic, early warning or diagnostic. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><div>Above those issues, we  face a two-fold challenge of boosting ecosystem behaviour and multiple stressor knowledge and working on the development of an identification system of indicators while we deal with the anthropogenic stressors which impact the integrity of biological ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite> </div><h3>Proposing the state of a healthy ecosystem</h3><div>Having mentioned the importance of evaluating the ecosystem health, it is proper to give a definition of what a healthy ecosystem is.                                     The healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite></div><div> </div><h3>Proposing the state of a healthy ecosystem</h3><div>Having mentioned the importance of evaluating the ecosystem health, it is proper to give a definition of what a healthy ecosystem is.
