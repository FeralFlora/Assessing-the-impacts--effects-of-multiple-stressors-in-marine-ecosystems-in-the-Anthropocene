<div><b>Hipoxia&nbsp;</b>The increasing frequency of blooms of nontoxic micro-algae and nuisance macro-algae is harmful because it dramatically reduces sunlight penetration in the water column. Large and long blooms can also draw a substantial amount of oxygen from the water column at night during respiration. Even though these events can occur seasonally, increasing water temperature and OA can change their frequency and intensity favouring the expansion of dead zones&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sherman_2017}</cite>.&nbsp;</div>
