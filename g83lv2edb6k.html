<div>Multivariate stressors deal with more than one variable. An example of these models is the practice of cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM), a method of modifying existing tools for univariate stressors, such as environmental impact assessment (EIA), for specific valued ecosystem components (VECs) for the use of CEAM. This method tries to assess cumulative effects for multiple actions using the tools of “encompass indicators, environmental indices, and habitat suitability models bases on pertinent indices”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Canter_2011}</cite>. Thus indicators and indices, dealing with only one variable or metric, are used for environmental studies creating an index or modelling. Assessing multivariate effects, one can see the potential adaption of these EIA tools for the usage in CEAM.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Canter_2011}</cite></div>
