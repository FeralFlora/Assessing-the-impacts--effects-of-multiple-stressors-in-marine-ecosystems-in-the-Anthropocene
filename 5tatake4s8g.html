In a next level, we are going to  use a ranking table for the different categories we found in the section above,  as this will be a helpful tool for the scientists to choose the appropriate  assessment method for each examined environment. These criteria can be  concluded as:</div><div>    </div><ul><li><b>Measurability</b> describes the ability of a  method to use indicators which are easy and cost-effective to measure, collect  and calculate.</li><li><b>Sensitivity</b> refers to the ability of a method to provide early  warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple  stressors over time.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Scalability&nbsp;</b>introduces the importance of a method to be  aggregated or disaggregated to a different spatial scale and still retain its  ability to indicate the change of interest and provide sufficient results for  the whole ecosystem.</li><li>  <b>Transferability/Universality</b> is the scope that a method  should be useful and easily applied to other locations and hence studies,  giving reliable and quantified information about all parts of the world.</li><li> <b>Comprehensibility/Communicability/Clarity </b>describes  whether or not the results of an assessment method can be easily communicated  to a wide audience. As multiple stressor issues usually involve exposures to  communities, information and understanding of the problem from the majority of  the community is a crucial step for further actions. </li></ul><div>During our literature review we came, als across with some important concepts. We are not in a position to link them directly to our criteria</div><ul><li><b>Dynamic processes consideration</b> Does the method take into  account dynamic processes, such as oceanographic currents or immigration? In  some cases, the absence of these processes may not affect the overall results  that emerge (Selkoe et al. 2008), but in others, it may be fundamentally  important (Halpern et al. 2008a).</li><li><b>Shifting baseline&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<b>consideration</b>&nbsp;</li></ul><div>            </div>
