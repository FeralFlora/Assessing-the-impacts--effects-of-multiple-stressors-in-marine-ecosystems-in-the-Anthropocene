<div>                                           where D<sub>i </sub>is the log-transformed and normalized value [scaled between 0 and  1] of an anthropogenic driver at location i. E<sub>j</sub> is the presence or absence of ecosystem  j (either 1 or 0, respectively), and Î¼<sub>i,j</sub> is the impact weight for the anthropogenic driver i and ecosystem j  [range 0 to 4] given n drivers and m ecosystems.
