<div>There is rising concern about the great impact of rising human activities; the marine ecosystems are significantly affected by a manifold of stressors caused by our society and our technologies. The challenges arising come from the complexity and network-based levels, direct and indirect interactions and interconnections between stressors, and the response dynamics and cascading effects of marine ecosystems and their stressors.&nbsp;<b>(Mention ecological surprises and nonlinear effects here).&nbsp;</b>Anthropogenic stressors are affecting our Earth's most vital organ; this is our dilemma. Furthermore, there is a lack of assessment methods implementing a cumulative effect of stressors; we are addressing the need for a solution, a water-mill concept if-you-will; the ability for variation and changes in an assessment method that could be applicable over a range of spatial and temporal scales. This topic fits into a semester-binding of ''The application of natural science in technology and society'' due to the relative cause and effect interactions between a faulty society, it's built technologies, and the impacts it has imposed on marine ecosystems.</div>
