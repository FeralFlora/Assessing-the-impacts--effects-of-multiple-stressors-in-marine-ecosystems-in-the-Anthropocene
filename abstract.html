<div>There is prominent concern about the impact of  issues surrounding human activities; the marine ecosystems are significantly affected by a manifold of stressors caused by our society and technologies. The challenges arising come from the complexity and network-based levels, direct and indirect interactions and interconnections between stressors, and the response dynamics and cascading effects of marine ecosystems and their stressors.&nbsp;<b>(Mention ecological surprises and nonlinear effects here).&nbsp;</b>Anthropogenic stressors are affecting our Earth's most vital system; this is our dilemma. Furthermore, there is a lack of assessment methods implementing a cumulative effect of stressors; we  address the need for a solution, a water-mill concept if-you-will; an assessment method with the ability for variation and changes in an environment  that is applicable over a range of spatial and temporal scales. This topic fits into a semester-binding of ''The application of natural science in technology and society'' due to the relative cause and effect connection between a faulty society, it's built technologies, and the impacts it has imposed on marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</div>
