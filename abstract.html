<div>There is an urgent concern towards increasing human activities and the effects that they have on our planet; one of the most significantly affected by this manifold of stressors are the marine ecosystems. </div><div>Current approaches to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems are developed for single stressors. The cumulative impact of several stressors, however, may differ from the impact of the single stressors and can result in nonlinear effects and ecological surprises.</div><div>An adequate understanding to further propose an assessment method for the marine ecosystems together with the stressors that impact them. </div><div>The challenges of assessing how stressors affect those impacted ecosystems&nbsp;comes from the complexity and network-based ecosystem levels, direct and indirect interactions and interconnections between the stressors, and the response dynamics and cascading effects of marine ecosystems and their stressors - these are our dilemmas. &nbsp;From the  lack of assessment methods implementing a cumulative effect of stressors, we  address the need for a solution encompassing multiple stressor assessment methods, a water-mill concept if-you-will; an assessment method with the ability for variation and changes in an environment  that is applicable over a range of spatial and temporal scales.&nbsp;This topic fits into a semester-binding of ''The application of natural science in technology and society'' due to the relative cause and effect connection between a faulty society, it's built technologies, and the impacts it has imposed on marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</div>
