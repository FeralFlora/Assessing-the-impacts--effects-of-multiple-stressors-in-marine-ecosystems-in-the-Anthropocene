  abstract = {What is ecotoxicology for? One important answer to this question is to in-form ecological risk assessment, that is, to provide a basis for assessing whether industrial and agricultural chemicals are likely to have adverse effects on ecosystems and hence provide a foundation for managing them. But ecotoxicology has evolved more from toxicology than ecology, and so there are those who argue that it is too simplistic to do the job effectively. This begs a number of questions that we shall address in this article: What kinds of adverse ecological effects are of concern in ecological risk assessment? How can we anticipate these effects to put into practice appropriate controls? How can we check the effectiveness of these approaches? Extrapolating the results of ecotoxicological tests to likely ecosystem effects undoubtedly involves a number of uncertainties. We shall discuss sources of these uncertainties and suggest ways that they might be addressed. Recent research suggests that there may be some general rules, which should increase our confidence in extrapolating results from simple to more complex ecological systems. However, there re-mains substantial room for improvement.},

Current approaches to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to aquatic ecosystems are developed for single stressors and determine stressor effects primarily as a function of stressor properties. The cumulative impact of several stressors, however, may differ markedly from the impact of the single stressors and can result in nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. To meet the challenge of diagnosing and predicting multiple stressor impacts, assessment strategies should focus on properties of the biological receptors rather than on stressor properties. This change of paradigm is required because (i) multiple stressors affect multiple biological targets at multiple organizational levels, (ii) biological receptors differ in their sensitivities, vulnerabilities, and response dynamics to the individual stressors, and (iii) biological receptors function as networks, so that actions of stressors at disparate sites within the network can lea...},

In several marine regions, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea, legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem-based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20{\%} of the entire basin and 60-99{\%} of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted, with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1{\%} of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers, rather than one individual use or stressor, with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV, and acidification), demersal fishing, ship traffic, and, in coastal areas, pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Rapid deterioration of the world's major ecosystems has intensified the need for effective environmental monitoring and the development of operational indicators of ecosystem health. Ecosystem health represents a desired endpoint of environmental management, but it requires adaptive, ongoing definition and assessment. We propose that a healthy ecosystem is one that is sustainable - that is, it has the ability to maintain its structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience). Various methods to quantify these three ecosystem attributes (vigor, organization, and resilience) are discussed. These attributes are then folded into a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health. A network analysis based ecosystem health assessment is developed and tested using trophic exchange networks representing several different aquatic ecosystems. Results indicate the potential of such an ecosystem health assessment for evaluating the relative health of similar ecosystems, and quantifying the effects of natural or anthropogenic stress on the health of a particular ecosystem over time.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Although the terms {\&}apos;health{\&}apos; and {\&}apos;healthy{\&}apos; are often applied to marine ecosystems and communicate information about holistic condition (e.g. as required by the Ecosystem Approach), their meaning is unclear. Ecosystems have been understood in various ways, from non-interacting populations of species to complex integrated systems. Health has been seen as a metaphor, an indicator that aggregates over system components, or a non-localized emergent system property. After a review, we define good ecosystem health as: {\&}apos;the condition of a system that is self-maintaining, vigorous, resilient to externally imposed pressures, and able to sustain services to humans. It contains healthy organisms and populations, and adequate functional diversity and functional response diversity. All expected trophic levels are present and well interconnected, and there is good spatial connectivity amongst subsystems.{\&}apos; We equate this condition with good ecological or environmental status, e.g. as referred to by recent EU Directives. Resilience is central to health, but difficult to measure directly. Ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure are at risk of losing resilience, and thus of suffering regime shifts and loss of services. For monitoring whole ecosystems, we propose an approach based on {\&}apos;trajectories in ecosystem state space{\&}apos;, illustrated with time-series from the northwestern North Sea. Change is visualized as Euclidian distance from an arbitrary reference state. Variability about a trend in distance is used as a proxy for inverse resilience. We identify the need for institutional support for long time-series to underpin this approach, and for research to establish state space co-ordinates for systems in good health. Changes in the northern North Sea, 1958-2008, plotted in a state space defined by the breeding success of kittiwakes, abundance of copepods Calanus spp., and simulated annual primary production.{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013. www.int-res.com.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, metaphors drawn from human health are finding increasing application in environmental assessment at ecosystem levels. If ecosystem medicine is to come of age, it must cope with three fundamental dilemmas. The first stems from the recognition that there are no strictly objective criteria for judging health. Assessments of health, as in humans, inevitably are based on some combination of established norms and desirable attributes. The second stems from the irregular pulse of nature which either precludes the early recognition of substantive changes or gives rise to false alarms. The third is posed by the quest for indicators that have the attributes of being holistic, early warning, and diagnostic. Indicators that excel in one of these aspects, often fail in another. Advances in ecosystem medicine are likely to come from closer collaboration with medical colleagues in both clinical and epidemiological areas. In particular the time appears ripe for a more systematic effort to characterize ecosystem maladies, to validate treatments and to develop more sophisticated diagnostic protocols. These aspects are illustrated with comparisons drawn from studies of environmental transformation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, the Baltic Sea and Canadian terrestrial ecosystems.},

@incollection{Gaedke2009,
  abstract = {The species populations within an ecosystem can be organized according to feeding levels (trophic levels). Photoautotrophs, which produce organic matter from inorganic materials using solar energy, are the first level (algae, aquatic vascular plants). The second trophic level consists of herbivores, which also may be called grazers (including many types of zooplankton and other invertebrates). Herbivores are eaten by primary carnivores (carnivorous zooplankton and many fish). In some cases, a secondary carnivore level may also be very important (large fish that eat primary carnivores). A diagram of the feeding connections of all organisms in an ecosystem or part of an ecosystem is called a food web. The food web includes a grazer food chain, which passes from photoautotrophs to top carnivores. The food web also contains a detrital food chain, which is based on fecal matter, dead organisms, dissolved organic matter, and particulate matter coming from the watershed.  Often the trophic position of a species is intermediate between two trophic levels, because it feeds partially at one trophic level and partially at another trophic level. In this case, the species is assigned a fractional trophic level (e.g., 2.5). Species populations that have similar feeding and predation relationships sometimes are grouped together as trophic guilds for modeling purposes. The passage of energy or materials through a food web can be estimated from use of field data to calibrate a model showing the transfer of energy, carbon, or other substances through the food web. Efficiency of trophic transfer (proportion of energy or mass passed from one trophic level to the next) can be used in comparing food webs across ecosystems or within specific parts of an ecosystem. Trophic transfer efficiency may be related to physical conditions. In open water, for example, food chains tend to be longer because all plants are small and must be eaten by small herbivores, which support small carnivores that are eaten by large carnivores. Food-web analysis explains why some food webs are more efficient than others, and why some feeding levels suppress others. Thus, food-web analysis promotes an understanding of feeding relationships within ecosystems.},

Complex interactions within food webs may limit trophic cascades, and researchers have debated where trophic cascades are most likely to occur and their relative strength. Nevertheless, trophic cascades are widely observed in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in trophic cascades may shift systems to alternate states, and trophic cascades influence many processes, including biogeochemical cycling, crosshabitat linkages, and ecosystem services. Restoration of predators and resulting trophic cascades are important targets for conservation that can contribute to sustaining biodiversity.},

This primary production supports essentially all life in the oceans and profoundly affects global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This review discusses the general distribution of primary production in the sea, the processes that regulate this distribution, and how marine primary production is sensitive to climate variability and change. Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations. A paleoclimate record extends discussion to the centennial scale, providing contrasting insights into how marine primary production might vary in the future.},

  abstract = {The global carbon cycle is strongly controlled by the ocean because it is the largest carbon reservoir at the Earth surface and it absorbs 25{\%} of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The net ocean–atmosphere CO2 flux is controlled by a thermodynamic pump (CO2 solubility is higher when water get colder) and a biological pump (photosynthesis consumes CO2). Hence carbon is transferred from the surface ocean to the deep ocean by downwelling of cold and dense waters and by sinking of dead organic matter. In the surface ocean, the average dissolved CO2 concentration increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2. The buffering effect of carbonate system chemical equilibria amplifies carbon storage and reduces the lowering of the pH also called acidification. Elemental and isotopic tracers show that anthropic CO2 has invaded the thermocline and has started spreading in the deep Atlantic ocean with NADW and AABW.},

  abstract = {Increases in Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) as a result of global warming have caused reef-building scleractinian corals to bleach worldwide, a result of the loss of obligate endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Since the 1980's, bleaching severity and frequency has increased, in some cases causing mass mortality of corals. Earlier experiments have demonstrated that zooxanthellae in scleractinian corals from three families from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Faviidae, Poritidae, and Acroporidae) are more sensitive to heat stress than their hosts, exhibiting differential symptoms of programmed cell death - apoptosis and necrosis. Most zooxanthellar phylotypes are dying during expulsion upon release from the host. The host corals appear to be adapted or exapted to the heat increases. We attempt to determine whether this adaptation/exaptation occurs in octocorals by examining the heat-sensitivities of zooxanthellae and their host octocoral alcyonacean soft corals - Sarcophyton ehrenbergi (Alcyoniidae), Sinularia lochmodes (Alcyoniidae), and Xenia elongata (Xeniidae), species from two different families. The soft coral holobionts were subjected to experimental seawater temperatures of 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36°C for 48 hrs. Host and zooxanthellar cells were examined for viability, apoptosis, and necrosis (in hospite and expelled) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescent microscopy (FM), and flow cytometry (FC). As experimental temperatures increased, zooxanthellae generally exhibited apoptotic and necrotic symptoms at lower temperatures than host cells and were expelled. Responses varied species-specifically. Soft coral hosts were adapted/exapted to higher seawater temperatures than their zooxanthellae. As with the scleractinians, the zooxanthellae appear to be the limiting factor for survival of the holobiont in the groups tested, in this region. These limits have now been shown to operate in six species within five families and two orders of the Cnidaria in the western Pacific. We hypothesize that this relationship may have taxonomic implications for other obligate zooxanthellate cnidarians subject to bleaching.},

Conversely, some toxic chemicals modify the exposure of aquatic species to other stressors by affecting species distribution, behaviour or habitat. Across Canada there are a number of specific examples where interactions between contaminants and environmental change are probably harming aquatic species.

  abstract = {Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental chal-lenges that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we have identified a number of circumstan-ces where chemicals and environmental variability have likely worked together to affect vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes, exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these endan-gered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmo-nids, which led to a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality. Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.

@article{Hooper2013,
  abstract = {Incorporation of global climate change (GCC) effects into assessments of chemical risk and injury requires integrated examinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors. Environmental variables altered by GCC (temperature, precipitation, salinity, pH) can influence the toxicokinetics of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as toxicodynamic interactions between chemicals and target molecules. In addition, GCC challenges processes critical for coping with the external environment (water balance, thermoregulation, nutrition, and the immune, endocrine, and neurological systems), leaving organisms sensitive to even slight perturbations by chemicals when pushed to the limits of their physiological tolerance range. In simplest terms, GCC can make organisms more sensitive to chemical stressors, while alternatively, exposure to chemicals can make organisms more sensitive to GCC stressors. One challenge is to identify potential interactions between nonchemical and chemical stressors affecting key physiological processes in an organism. We employed adverse outcome pathways, constructs depicting linkages between mechanism-based molecular initiating events and impacts on individuals or populations, to assess how chemical- and climate-specific variables interact to lead to adverse outcomes. Case examples are presented for prospective scenarios, hypothesizing potential chemicalGCC interactions, and retrospective scenarios, proposing mechanisms for demonstrated chemicalclimate interactions in natural populations. Understanding GCC interactions along adverse outcome pathways facilitates extrapolation between species or other levels of organization, development of hypotheses and focal areas for further research, and improved inputs for risk and resource injury assessments.

@article{Paine1998,
  abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of distur- bance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Conse- quently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturba- tions within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physi- cally based disturbance (for example, storm, volca- nic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dis- persal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that de- scribe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ‘‘ecological surprises.'' In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state.We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthro- pogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century. Key},

  abstract = {The number of combinations of anthropogenic stressors affecting global change is increasing; however, few studies have empirically tested for their interactive effects on ecosystems. Most importantly, interactions among ecological stressors generate nonadditive effects that cannot be easily predicted based on single-stressor studies. Here, we corroborate findings from an in situ mesocosm experiment with evidence from a whole-ecosystem manipulation to demonstrate for the first time that interactions between climate and acidification determine their cumulative impact on the food-web structure of coldwater lakes. Interactions among warming, drought, and acidification, rather than the sum of their individual effects, best explained significant changes in planktonic consumer and producer biomass over a 23-year period. Further, these stressors interactively exerted significant synergistic and antagonistic effects on consumers and producers, respectively. The observed prevalence of long- and short-term ecological surprises involving the cumulative impacts of multiple anthropogenic stressors highlights the high degree of uncertainty surrounding current forecasts of the consequences of global change.},

@article{Gutt2015a,
  abstract = {A quantitative assessment of observed and projected environmental changes in the Southern Ocean (SO) with a potential impact on the marine ecosystem shows: (i) large proportions of the SO are and will be affected by one or more climate change processes; areas projected to be affected in the future are larger than areas that are already under environmental stress, (ii) areas affected by changes in sea-ice in the past and likely in the future are much larger than areas affected by ocean warming. The smallest areas ({\textless}1{\%} area of the SO) are affected by glacier retreat and warming in the deeper euphotic layer. In the future, decrease in the sea-ice is expected to be widespread. Changes in iceberg impact resulting from further collapse of ice-shelves can potentially affect large parts of shelf and ephemerally in the off-shore regions. However, aragonite undersaturation (acidification) might become one of the biggest problems for the Antarctic marine ecosystem by affecting almost the entire SO. Direct and indirect impacts of various environmen- tal changes to the three major habitats, sea-ice, pelagic and benthos and their biota are complex. The areas affected by environmental stressors range from 33{\%} of the SO for a single stressor, 11{\%} for two and 2{\%} for three, to {\textless}1{\%} for four and five overlapping factors. In the future, areas expected to be affected by 2 and 3 overlapping factors are equally large, including potential iceberg changes, and together cover almost 86{\%} of the SO ecosystem.},

These complexities have challenged the use and utility of threshold concepts in environmental management despite great concern about prevent-ing dramatic state changes in valued ecosystems, the need for determining critical pollutant loads and the ubiquity of other threshold-based envi-ronmental problems. In this paper we define the scope of the thresholds concept in ecological sci-ence and discuss methods for identifying and investigating thresholds using a variety of examples from terrestrial and aquatic environments, at eco-system, landscape and regional scales.

@article{Porter1999,
  abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay. By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P {\textgreater} 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any environmentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.},

@article{Crain2008,
  abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26{\%}), synergistic (36{\%}), and antagonistic (38{\%}). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

@article{Halpern2007,
  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are threatened by a suite of anthropogenic stressors. Mitigating multiple threats is a daunting task, particularly when funding constraints limit the number of threats that can be addressed. Threats are typically assessed and prioritized via expert opinion workshops that often leave no record of the rationale for decisions, making it difficult to update recommendations with new information. We devised a transparent, repeatable, and modifiable method for collecting expert opinion that describes and documents how threats affect marine ecosystems. Experts were asked to assess the functional impact, scale, and frequency of a threat to an ecosystem; the resistance and recovery time of an ecosystem to a threat; and the certainty of these estimates. To quantify impacts of 38 distinct anthropogenic threats on 23 marine ecosystems, we surveyed 135 experts from 19 different countries. Survey results showed that all ecosystems are threatened by at least nine threats and that nine ecosystems are threatened by {\textgreater}90{\%} of existing threats. The greatest threats (highest impact scores) were increasing sea temperature, demersal destructive fishing, and point-source organic pollution. Rocky reef, coral reef, hard-shelf, mangrove, and offshore epipelagic ecosystems were identified as the most threatened. These general results, however, may be partly influenced by the specific expertise and geography of respondents, and should be interpreted with caution. This approach to threat analysis can identify the greatest threats (globally or locally), most widespread threats, most (or least) sensitive ecosystems, most (or least) threatened ecosystems, and other metrics of conservation value. Additionally, it can be easily modified, updated as new data become available, and scaled to local or regional settings, which would facilitate informed and transparent conservation priority setting.},

@article{Hattam2015,
  abstract = {There is a multitude of ecosystem service classifications available within the literature, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Elements of them have been used to tailor a generic ecosystem service classification for the marine environment and then for a case study site within the North Sea: the Dogger Bank. Indicators for each of the ecosystem services, deemed relevant to the case study site, were identified. Each indicator was then assessed against a set of agreed criteria to ensure its relevance and applicability to environmental management. This paper identifies the need to distinguish between indicators of ecosystem services that are entirely ecological in nature (and largely reveal the potential of an ecosystem to provide ecosystem services), indicators for the ecological processes contributing to the delivery of these services, and indicators of benefits that reveal the realized human use or enjoyment of an ecosystem service. It highlights some of the difficulties faced in selecting meaningful indicators, such as problems of specificity, spatial disconnect and the considerable uncertainty about marine species, habitats and the processes, functions and services they contribute to.},

We have tackled the following principles: the ecosystem-based approach, the development of benthic indicators, the definition of 'pristine' or sustainable conditions, the detection of pressures and the development of monitoring programs. We concluded that testing and integrating the different approaches was facilitated during the WFD process, which led to further insights and improvements, which the MSFD can rely upon. Expert involvement in the entire implementation process proved to be of vital importance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Climate change is unambiguous and its effects are clearly detected in all functional units of the Earth system. This study presents new analyses of sea-surface temperature changes and show that climate change is affecting ecosystems of the North Atlantic. Changes are seen from phytoplankton to zooplankton to fish and are modifying the dominance of species and the structure, the diversity and the functioning of marine ecosystems. Changes also range from phenological to biogeographical shifts and have involved in some regions of the Atlantic abrupt ecosystem shifts. These alterations reflect a response of pelagic ecosystems to a warmer temperature regime. Mechanisms are complex because they are nonlinear exhibiting tipping points and varying in space and time. Sensitivity of organisms to temperature changes is high, implicating that a small temperature modification can have sustained ecosystem effects. Implications of these changes for biogeochemical cycles are discussed. Two observed changes detected in the North Sea that could have opposite effects on carbon cycle are discussed. Increase in phytoplankton, as inferred from the phytoplankton colour index derived from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, has been detected in the North Sea. This pattern has been accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of the herbivorous species Calanus finmarchicus. This might have reduced the grazing pressure and increase diatomaceous 'fluff', therefore carbon export in the North Sea. Therefore, it could be argued that the biological carbon pump might increase in this region with sea warming. In the meantime, however, the mean size of organisms (calanoid copepods) has dropped. Such changes have implications for the turnover time of biogenic carbon in plankton organisms and the mean residence time of particulate carbon they produce. The system characterising the warmer period is more based on recycling and less on export. The increase in the minimum turnover time indicates an increase in the ecosystem metabolism, which can be considered as a response of the pelagic ecosystems to climate warming. This phenomenon could reduce carbon export. These two opposite patterns of change are examples of the diversity of mechanisms and pathways the ecosystems may exhibit with climate change. Oversimplification of current biogeochemical models, often due to lack of data and biological understanding, could lead to wrong projection on the direction ecosystems and therefore some biogeochemical cycles might take in a warmer world. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

  abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive will have instituted the concept of Ecological Quality Status (EQS) as a way to assess the biological quality of water masses. The EQS will be based mainly upon the composition of the different biological compartments in the ecosystem specially the benthos as compared to certain reference sites. Such management tools are already well established for freshwater (i.e. biotic indices), but not for coastal and estuarine (i.e. transitional) waters. In the framework of the Seine-Aval programme a workshop on benthic indicators was organized at Wimereux (France) in June 2005. The aim of this workshop and this paper is (1) to present the experiences of the Seine Aval researchers, and the French scientific approaches to benthic indicators, with those international experiences and approaches that have been published or are under development; and (2) to examine the existing benthic tools and their possible use in the characterization of the state of estuarine ecosystems. The debate during the workshop and the numerous recently published on the WFD are discussed in term of the implementation of the WFD in transitional water bodies using benthic indicators and indices. Some proposals for the future underline the needs to re-examine and adapt the different index thresholds, to take into account physical disturbances, to inventory the existing conditions vs reference conditions and to be as pragmatic as possible in using the WFD in transitional waters. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Elliott2007,
  abstract = {Estuaries have long been regarded as environmentally naturally stressed areas because of the high degree of variability in their physico-chemical characteristics, for example oxygen, temperature and salinity in the water column and bed sediment dynamics. However, their biota is well-adapted to cope with that stress and so the areas may be regarded as resilient because of that inherent variability; their ability to absorb stress without adverse effects is regarded here as Environmental Homeostasis. Hence these areas may only be regarded as stressful for marine or freshwater-adapted organisms and that for estuarine organisms this environmental stress is regarded as a subsidy whereby they successfully capitalise on the stressful conditions. In addition, using examples of the estuarine fauna and flora, this article indicates that the characteristics of natural stress in estuaries are similar to those for anthropogenic stress. An over-reliance on ecosystem structural features, such as diversity, in quality indicators therefore makes the detection of the anthropogenic stress more difficult. This difficulty is termed the Estuarine Quality Paradox. Because of these difficulties, the article argues that functional characteristics either as well as or rather than structural ones should be used in detecting environmental perturbations in estuaries. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {English It is becoming increasingly clear that humans impact marine ecosystems and their biodiversity to a very considerate degree, and evidence of the scale of impact is growing. An enabling factor for this has been a change in focus from local-level studies to increased emphasis on meta-analysis of global or regional-level analysis of fisheries' impact. Results include the facts that the world's total fish catches have been decreasing over the last decade or more; that larger, predatory fishes (table fish) are becoming increasingly scarcer; and that we are appropriating the ocean shelves' primary productivity to the same level as we are for terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystems are being eroded in countries throughout the world, and though one might get the impression from the IUCN Red List that it is mainly a developed-country problem, it is alarming that the impact of severe overfishing may be on an even larger scale for developing countries. We describe aspects of the risks overfishing poses to marine ecosystems, and point out how ecosystem approaches to fisheries can be used to evaluate the potential impact of alternative fishing policy scenarios. French Il devient de plus en plus clair que les activites humaines alterent les ecosystemes marins et leur biodiversite a un degre considerable, et les preures de l'echelle des impacts anthropiques s'accumulent. Un des facteurs determinants de cette prise de conscience reside dans le changement d'echelle des etudes de l'impact des peches qui sont passees d'un niveau local a un niveau global ou regional au travers d'etudes de type meta-analyse. Les resultats obtenus les plus evocateurs incluent le fait que la totalite des captures mondiales de poissons a diminue pendant la derniere decennie ou plus; que les grands predateurs (l'essentiel des poissons de table) deviennent de plus en plus rares; et que nous nous approprions la productivite primaire des plateaux continentaux au meme titre que nous nous sommes appropries celle des ecosystemes terrestres. Les ecosystemes sont erodes dans les pays du monde entier, et bien que la liste rouge de l'IUCN laisse penser que c'est principalement le probleme des pays developpes, il est alarmant de constater que l'impact de la surpeche excessive pourrait etre une echelle bien plus grande encore pour les pays en voie de developpement. Nous decrivons certains aspects des risques que pose la surpeche pour les ecosystemes marins, et mettons en exergue comment l'approche ecosystemique des peches peut etre employee pour evaluer l'impact potentiel de scenarios alternatifs de reglementation des peches.},

@article{Haines-Young2012,
  abstract = {This study develops an approach to mapping indicators of the potential of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services, and the impact of changes in land cover and use upon them. The study focuses on the EU-25 plus Switzerland and Norway, and develops the methodology proposed by Kienast et al. (2009), which uses expert-and literature-driven modelling methods. The methods are explored in relation to mapping and assessing four of the ecosystem services: Crop-based production; Wildlife products; Habitat diversity; and Recreation. The potential to deliver services is assumed to be influenced by (a) land-use, (b) net primary production, and (c) bioclimatic and landscape properties such as mountainous terrain, adjacency to coastal and wetland ecosystems, as well as adjacency to landscape and nature protection zones. The novel aspect of this work is an analysis of whether the historical and the projected land use changes for the periods 1990-2000, 2000-2006, and 2000-2030 are likely to be supportive or degenerative in the capacity of ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services; we refer to these as 'marginal' or incremental changes. The latter are assessed by using land account data for 1990-2000 and 2000-2006 (LEAC, EEA, 2006) and EURURALIS 2.0 land use scenarios for 2000-2030. The results are reported at three spatial reporting units, i.e. (1) the NUTS-X regions, (2) the bioclimatic regions, and (3) the dominant landscape types. All mapped output has been compared with independently generated continent-wide assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental parameters/indicators), which revealed that the straightforward binary links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns. This conclusion mainly holds for provisioning services. At the continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies which can be used to assess the medium-term potential of landscapes to provide ecosystem services. For a subset of NUTS-x regions for which change trajectories for 1990-2000, 2000-2006 and 2000-2030 are available, trade-offs between the four services have been analyzed using cluster analyses. The latter allowed us to simultaneously analyze the state of the four services in year 2000 and the individual trajectories of each service over three time periods. As a result we obtained seven regions with distinct trade-off patterns. To our knowledge this is one of the first continental-wide analyses where land use trajectories are taken into account to construct an indicator to estimate the balance between a set or bundle of ecosystem services. The relationship between the outputs of this work and the development of rapid assessment and accounting frameworks is discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Ocean models predict declines of 1 to 7{\%} in the global ocean O2 inventory over the next century, with declines continuing for a thousand years or more into the future. An important consequence may be an expansion in the area and volume of so-called oxygen minimum zones, where O2 levels are too low to support many macrofauna and profound changes in biogeochemical cycling occur. Significant deoxygenation has occurred over the past 50 years in the North Pacific and tropical oceans, suggesting larger changes are looming. The potential for larger O2 declines in the future suggests the need for an improved observing system for tracking ocean 02 changes.},

  abstract = {As the oceans absorb anthropogenic CO2 they become more acidic, a problem termed ocean acidification (OA). Since this increase in CO2 is occurring rapidly, OA may have profound implications for marine ecosystems. In the temperate northeast Pacific, fisheries play key economic and cultural roles and provide significant employment, especially in rural areas. In British Columbia (BC), sport (recreational) fishing generates more income than commercial fishing (including the expanding aquaculture industry). Salmon (fished recreationally and farmed) and Pacific Halibut are responsible for the majority of fishery-related income. This region naturally has relatively acidic (low pH) waters due to ocean circulation, and so may be particularly vulnerable to OA. We have analyzed available data to provide a current description of the marine ecosystem, focusing on vertical distributions of commercially harvested groups in BC in the context of local carbon and pH conditions. We then evaluated the potential impact of OA on this temperate marine system using currently available studies. Our results highlight significant knowledge gaps. Above trophic levels 2–3 (where most local fishery-income is generated), little is known about the direct impact of OA, and more importantly about the combined impact of multi-stressors, like temperature, that are also changing as our climate changes. There is evidence that OA may have indirect negative impacts on finfish through changes at lower trophic levels and in habitats. In particular, OA may lead to increased fish-killing algal blooms that can affect the lucrative salmon aquaculture industry. On the other hand, some species of locally farmed shellfish have been well-studied and exhibit significant negative direct impacts associated with OA, especially at the larval stage. We summarize the direct and indirect impacts of OA on all groups of marine organisms in this region and provide conclusions, ordered by immediacy and certainty.},

These concerned professionals called on humankind to curtail environmental destruction and cautioned that “a great change in our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided.” In their manifesto, they showed that humans were on a collision course with the natural world. They expressed concern about current, impending, or potential damage on planet Earth involving ozone depletion, freshwater availability, marine fishery collapses, ocean dead zones, forest loss, biodiversity destruction, climate change, and continued human population growth. They proclaimed that fundamental changes were urgently needed to avoid the consequences our present course would bring.},

@article{Hunsicker2016,
  abstract = {Scientists and resource managers often use methods and tools that assume ecosystem components respond linearly to environmental drivers and human stressors. However, a growing body of literature demonstrates that many relationships are non- linear, where small changes in a driver prompt a disproportionately large ecological response. We aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the relationships between drivers and eco- system components to identify where and when non- linearities are likely to occur. We focused our analyses on one of the best- studied marine systems, pelagic ecosystems, which allowed us to apply robust statistical techniques on a large pool of previously published studies. In this synthesis, we (1) conduct a wide literature review on single driver–response relationships in pelagic systems, (2) use statistical models to identify the degree of non- linearity in these relationships, and (3) assess whether general patterns exist in the strengths and shapes of non- linear relationships across drivers. Overall we found that non- linearities are common in pelagic ecosystems, comprising at least 52{\%} of all driver–response relation- ships. This is likely an underestimate, as papers with higher quality data and analytical approaches reported non- linear relationships at a higher frequency (on average 11{\%} more). Consequently, in the absence of evidence for a linear relationship, it is safer to assume a relationship is non- linear. Strong non- linearities can lead to greater ecological and socio- economic consequences if they are unknown (and/or unanticipated), but if known they may provide clear thresholds to inform management targets. In pelagic systems, strongly non- linear relationships are often driven by climate and trophodynamic variables but are also associated with local stressors, such as overfishing and pollution, that can be more easily controlled by managers. Even when marine resource managers cannot influence ecosystem change, they can use information about threshold responses to guide how other stressors are managed and to adapt to new ocean conditions. As methods to detect and reduce uncertainty around threshold values improve, managers will be able to better under- stand and account for ubiquitous non- linear relationships.},

Here, we apply methods developed to map cumulative impacts globally to the California Current using more comprehensive and higher-quality data for 25 human activities and 19 marine ecosystems. This analysis indicates where protection and threat mitigation are most needed in the California Current and reveals that coastal ecosystems near high human population density and the continental shelves off Oregon and Washington are the most heavily impacted, climate change is the top threat, and impacts from multiple threats are ubiquitous. Remarkably, these results were highly spatially correlated with the global results for this region (R(2) = 0.92), suggesting that the global model provides guidance to areas without local data or resources to conduct similar regional-scale analyses.},

Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41{\%}) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research.},

  abstract = {The “ecosystem approach” to environmental management is viewed by many as being fundamental to the development of appropriate management strategies. While this approach represents a major advance in the way researchers view environmental assessment, the approach in itself does not provide practical information as to what questions to ask and what tools to use in assessing and managing ecosystems. Similarly, the concept of ecosystem health, as it is usually defined, has little practical value for ecosystem managers. We suggest the next stage in environmental assessment will be the development of specific frameworks designed to assess individual ecosystems. Of primary importance is the need to consider the basic structure and function of the ecosystem itself. Such consideration, together with explicit identification of anthropogenic stresses particular to the system, serves to identify those components most at risk and those issues most deserving of attention. Researchers should explore critical linkages between environmental stressors and their observable, measurable and predictable effects on ecological parameters and use this understanding to develop a management strategy that incorporates appropriate ecological indicators. The importance of these considerations will be illustrated using examples from the Northern River Basins Study.},

  abstract = {Biotic indices have become key assessment tools in most recent national and trans-national policies aimed at improving the quality of coastal waters and the integrity of their associated ecosystems. In this study we analyzed 90 published biotic indices, classified them into four types, and analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each type in relation to the requirements of these policies. We identified three main type-specific weaknesses. First, the problems of applicability, due to practical and conceptual difficulties, which affect most indices related to ecosystem function. Second, the failure of many indices based on structural attributes of the community (e.g. taxonomic composition) to link deterioration with causative stressors, or to provide an early-detection capacity. Third, the poor relevance to the ecological integrity of indices based on attributes at the sub-individual level (e.g. multi-biomarkers). Additionally, most indices still fail on two further aspects: the broad-scale applicability and the definition of reference conditions. Nowadays, the most promising approach seems to be the aggregation of indices with complementary strengths, and obtained from different biological communities.},

@article{Borja2009,
  abstract = {During the last decade, there have been substantial scientific advances in the development of indices that measure the condition of biological ecosystem elements in coastal and estuarine waters. Though successful, these advances were only the initial steps and a special session on use of indices in ecological integrity assessments was held at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation meeting to focus the field on the most appropriate directions for the next decade. The session identified four primary scientific challenges: (i) reduce the array of indices by identifying the index approaches that are most widely successful; (ii) establish minimum criteria for index validation; (iii) intercalibrate methods to achieve uniform assessment scales across geographies and habitats; and (iv) integrate indices across ecosystem elements. Where an explosion of indices characterized the last decade, the next decade needs to be characterized by consolidation. With increased knowledge and understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of competing index approaches, the field needs to unify approaches that provide managers with the simple answers they need to use ecological condition information effectively and efficiently. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in ocean and coastal management is to find simple ways to evaluate the health of such complex ecosystems. This task may prove complicated as selection criteria needs to be established for choosing appropriate indicators and evaluation tools which do not mask or leave out inherent ecosystem properties and dynamics. Here, we review some empirical analyses and modelling techniques which can be used to derive environmental health indicators. With a series of case studies ranging from the combined use of structural and functional attributes of the system, to modelling outputs that integrate the biological and physical environments, we illustrate the usefulness and complementarities of these methods to assess ecosystem health. The choice of relevant indicators will depend on the ecological questions raised as well as the biological and habitat components considered which can range from a single level (individual or population) to multiple levels (community or ecosystem-based indicators) in the ecosystem. Each method has its own capabilities and limitations that may render it useful or insufficient in some cases. We suggest, however, that, whenever possible, the combination of ecological attributes and tools should be used to improve our knowledge and assessment of marine ecosystems for better management and conservation in the future. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {We present a phased approach for evaluating the effects of physical, biological, chemical, and psychosocial stressors that may act in combination. Although a phased concept is common to many risk-based approaches, it has not been explicitly outlined for the assessment of combined effects of multiple stressors. The approach begins with the development of appropriate conceptual models and assessment end points. The approach then proceeds through a screening stage wherein stressors are evaluated with respect to their potential importance as contributors to risk. Stressors are considered individually or as a combination of independent factors with respect to one or more common assessment end points. As necessary, the approach then proceeds to consider interactions among stressors. We make a distinction between applications that begin with effects of concern (effects based) or with specific stressors (stressor based). We describe a number of tools for use within the phased approach. The methods profiled are ones that have been applied to yield results that can be communicated to a wide audience. The latter characteristic is considered especially important because multiple stressor problems usually involve exposures to communities or to ecologic regions with many stakeholders.},

The present paper discusses the limitations of the current risk-assessment approaches and how multiple stressors at large scales can be better evaluated in ecological risk assessments to inform the development of more efficient and preventive management policies based on adaptive management in the future. A future risk-assessment paradigm that overcomes these limitations is presented. This paradigm includes cultural and ecological protection goals, the development of ecological scenarios, the establishment of the relevant interactions among species, potential sources of stressors, their interactions and the development of cause–effect models. It is envisaged that this will be achievable through a greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines and through the application of new and emerging tools such as 'big data', ecological modelling and the incorporation of ecosystem service endpoints.},

@article{Goussen2016,
  abstract = {Current environmental risk assessments (ERA) do not account explicitly for ecological factors (e.g. species composition, temperature or food availability) and multiple stressors. Assessing mixtures of chemical and ecological stressors is needed as well as accounting for variability in environmental conditions and uncertainty of data and models. Here we propose a novel probabilistic ERA framework to overcome these limitations, which focusses on visualising assessment outcomes by construct-ing and interpreting prevalence plots as a quantitative prediction of risk. Key components include environmental scenarios that integrate exposure and ecology, and ecological modelling of relevant endpoints to assess the effect of a combination of stressors. Our illustrative results demonstrate the importance of regional differences in environmental conditions and the confounding interactions of stressors. Using this framework and prevalence plots provides a risk-based approach that combines risk assessment and risk management in a meaningful way and presents a truly mechanistic alternative to the threshold approach. Even whilst research continues to improve the underlying models and data, regulators and decision makers can already use the framework and prevalence plots. The integration of multiple stressors, environmental conditions and variability makes ERA more relevant and realistic.},

@article{Welle2017,
  abstract = {Coral cover has been declining in recent decades due to increased temperatures and envi- ronmental stressors. However, the extent to which different stressors contribute both indi- vidually and in concert to bleaching and mortality is still very uncertain.Wedevelop and use a novel regression approach, using non-linear parametric models that control for unob- served time invariant effects to estimate the effects on coral bleaching and mortality due to temperature, solar radiation, depth, hurricanes and anthropogenic stressors using historical data from a large bleaching event in 2005 across the Caribbean. Two separate models are created, one to predict coral bleaching, and the other to predict near-term mortality. A large ensemble of supporting data is assembled to control for omitted variable bias and improve fit, and a significant improvement in fit is observed from univariate linear regression based on temperature alone. The results suggest that climate stressors (temperature and radia- tion) far outweighed direct anthropogenic stressors (using distance from shore and nearby human population density as a proxy for such stressors) in driving coral health outcomes during the 2005 event. Indeed, temperature was found to play a role {\~{}}4 times greater in both the bleaching and mortality response than population density across their observed ranges. The empirical models tested in this study have large advantages over ordinary-least squares–they offer unbiased estimates for censored data, correct for spatial correlation, and are capable of handling more complex relationships between dependent and independent variables. The models offer a framework for preparing for future warming events and climate change; guiding monitoring and attribution of other bleaching and mortality events regionally and around the globe; and informing adaptive management and conservation efforts.},

@article{Foley2017,
  abstract = {The cumulative effects of increasing human use of the ocean and coastal zone have contributed to a rapid decline in ocean and coastal resources. As a result, scientists are investigating how multiple, overlapping stressors accumulate in the environment and impact ecosystems. These investigations are the foundation for the development of new tools that account for and predict cumulative effects in order to more adequately prevent or mitigate negative effects. Despite scientific advances, legal requirements, and management guidance, those who conduct assessments—including resource managers, agency staff, and consultants—continue to struggle to thoroughly evaluate cumulative effects, particularly as part of the environmental assessment process. Even though 45 years have passed since the United States National Environmental Policy Act was enacted, which set a precedent for environmental assessment around the world, defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance are still major challenges associated with assessing cumulative effects. In addition, we know little about how practitioners tackle these challenges or how assessment aligns with current scientific recommendations. To shed more light on these challenges and gaps, we undertook a comparative study on how cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is conducted by practitioners operating under some of the most well-developed environmental laws around the globe: California, USA; British Columbia, Canada; Queensland, Australia; and New Zealand. We found that practitioners used a broad and varied definition of impact for CEA, which led to differences in how baseline, scale, and significance were determined. We also found that practice and science are not closely aligned and, as such, we highlight opportunities for managers, policy makers, practitioners, and scientists to improve environmental assessment.},

Ecological risk assessment (ERA), which is aimed at appraising a wide range of undesirable impacts on ecosystems exposed to a possible eco-environmental hazard, has been highly recommended for environmental decision-making. The existing system-based eco-risk models at different levels of hierarchical organization are reviewed, including food web-based models, ecosystem-based models and socio-ecological models are reviewed. Based on this inspection, an integrated framework characterizing problem formulation, risk characterization and risk assessment is depicted to illumine future ecological risk assessments. The possibility of integrating the various ERA modeling systems is addressed through examining the interconnections between models shown within the context of our diagrams. Furthermore, some refinements of the current system-level techniques are proposed to meet the requirements of risk evaluation in a holistic and regulatory context. We conclude that assessing ecological risk by using system-based models at different levels of organization in a combined way is an evolutionary step for the application of risk evaluation in environmental management. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {1. Overview of impacts No part of the ocean has today completely escaped the impact of human pressures, including the most remote areas. One clear example of this is the universal presence of stratospheric fall-out from atmospheric nuclear-weapons testing, but many other pressures on the marine environment are nearly as widespread. Human pressures impact on the ocean in many and complex ways. They can take effect directly (as when an oil spill kills sea-birds and sessile benthic biota) or indirectly (as when climate change results in changes to the stratification of seawater, with an adverse effect on the nutrient cycle and the production of the plankton on which fish feed). Equally, the effects can be seen both on the natural environment (as when populations of sea turtles are reduced by tourist development on or near their breeding beaches) as well as on human society and economic activities (as when the collapse of a fish stock removes the economic base of coastal communities). Human pressures can also vary widely in their intensity and spread. Sometimes they have a concentrated impact: for example, the annual expansion of a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting from the high level of inputs of nitrogen compounds in the run-off from the Mississippi and other catchments. Sometimes the effects of human pressures have a very widely distributed effect: for example, the diffusion of persistent organic pollutants over the Arctic zone by airborne volatilization (for both examples, see Chapter 20 on land-based inputs) (Halpern, 2008). 1.1 Summarizing the impacts An analysis of the overall impact of all the human pressures examined in this Assessment has to start by looking at the direct impacts and collateral effects of each pressure and to examine where those impacts and effects are found. However (as argued below), although this is an essential first step, it is not enough. In addition, any review of the effects of human pressures on the marine environment has to look both at the effects on the marine environment and at the consequences for human society and economies. A taxonomy of the main sources of human pressures on the marine environment that need to be considered must include the following (though these are not listed in any order of priority): (a) Climate change (and ocean acidification, including the resulting changes in salinity, sea-level, ocean heat content and sea-ice coverage, reduction in oxygen content, changes in ultra-violet radiation);},

  abstract = {Increasing population pressure, urbanisation of the coastal zone and nutrient and sediment run-off from agriculture and forestry has increased the number of large-scale and chronic impacts affecting coastal and estuarine systems. The need to assess cumulative impacts is a major motivation for the current desire of managers and ecologists to define ecosystem health and stress. A number of univariate metrics have been proposed to monitor health, including indicator species, indicator ratios and diversity or contaminant metrics. Alternatively, multivariate methods can be used to test for changes in community structure due to stress. In this study we developed multivariate models using statistical ordination techniques to identify key stressors affecting the 'health' of estuarine macrofaunal communities. Macrofaunal and associated environmental samples were collected across 75 sites from within Tauranga Harbour, a large estuary located on New Zealand's North Island. The harbour receives discharges from urbanised, industrial, agricultural and horticultural catchments. Distance-based linear modelling identified sediments, nutrients and heavy metals as key 'stressors' affecting the ecology of the harbour. Therefore, three multivariate models were developed based on the variability in community composition using canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP). The multivariate models were found to be more sensitive to changing environmental health than simple univariate measures (abundance, species richness, evenness and Shannon-Wiener diversity) along an anthropogenic stress gradient. This multivariate approach can be used as a management or monitoring tool where sites are repeatedly sampled over time and tracked to determine whether the communities are moving towards a more healthy or unhealthy state. Ultimately, such statistical models provide a tool to forecast the distribution and abundance of species associated with habitat change and should enable long-term degradative change from multiple disturbances to be assessed.},

The main methodology applied is multivariate modelling (as opposed to univarate) on basis of various collected samples.

@misc{Schoepf2013,
  abstract = {Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations threaten coral reefs worldwide by causing ocean warming and acidification. When seawater temperatures are unusually high, corals lose a significant portion of their vital algal endosymbionts and/or photosynthetic pigments making them appear pale or white – a process referred to as coral bleaching. As corals get most of their carbon from the algal endosymbionts, the breakdown of this symbiosis significantly weakens coral and can lead to widespread mortality if bleaching is severe. Bleaching events have been predicted to become annual events sometime later this century. Despite this knowledge, the impacts of annual bleaching on coral physiology, biogeochemistry, and overall resilience remain largely unknown. For the first time, annually recurring bleaching was simulated on ecologically relevant timescales by subjecting three Caribbean coral species ( Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Porites divaricata ) to experimental coral bleaching (+1°C for 2.5 weeks) in two consecutive years. Impacts on their physiology and biogeochemistry were assessed in great detail immediately after repeat bleaching as well as after short and long term recovery. We show that repeat bleaching can dramatically alter thermal tolerance of the coral holobiont (i.e., animal host and endosymbiont). Species such as P. divaricata will be able to rapidly acclimate to frequent temperature stress and persist on future coral reefs, whereas others such as P. astreoides will show increasing bleaching susceptibility and may thus face significant decline. Coral skeletal carbon isotopes are important paleo-climate proxies and have the potential to record past bleaching events. However, they are often confounded by strong kinetic isotope effects that can mask the bleaching signal in the skeleton and compromise overall accuracy of the proxy. A proposed data correction to remove kinetic isotope effects was tested for the first time using bleached corals. In addition, it was tested if photosynthesis to respiration (P/R) ratios can be reliably calculated from coral isotopes. We found that the data correction did not effectively remove kinetic isotope effects, and that isotope-based P/R ratios are in poor agreement with P/R ratios measured by respirometry. Therefore, the data correction should not be routinely applied to paleo-climate reconstruction, and P/R ratios should be obtained by respirometry only. While the potential of some coral species to acclimate to frequent bleaching stress is encouraging, corals will also have to cope with increasingly more acidic seawater, which compromises calcification rates. Yet, the combined effects of ocean acidification (OA) and warming on coral physiology remain poorly understood. We therefore conducted a controlled tank experiment where four Pacific coral species (Acropora millepora, Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora monasteriata, and Turbinaria reniformis) were maintained at seawater pCO2 levels and temperatures expected by the end of this century (741 $\mu$atm, 29.0°C). Surprisingly, three of the four species studied were able to maintain calcification rates under these conditions. Further, we show for the first time that coral energy reserves were not catabolized to sustain calcification rates under OA conditions, which has important implications for coral health and bleaching resistance. Overall, the findings from this dissertation research highlight that some coral species will be able to survive predicted near-future ocean acidification and warming. However, as seawater pCO2 increases beyond 700 $\mu$atm and coral bleaching becomes more frequent and intense, temperature- and CO 2-sensitive species will likely face significant demise. Since this is likely to have dramatic consequences for coral reef diversity and overall reef functioning, the future of coral reefs beyond the 21st century may be uncertain.},

@article{Yee2010,
  abstract = {Coral reefs have experienced extensive mortality over the past few decades as a result of temperature-induced mass bleaching events. There is an increasing realization that other environmental factors, including water mixing, solar radiation, water depth, and water clarity, interact with temperature to either exacerbate bleaching or protect coral from mass bleaching. The relative contribution of these factors to variability in mass bleaching at a global scale has not been quantified, but can provide insights when making large-scale predictions of mass bleaching events. Using data from 708 bleaching surveys across the globe, a framework was developed to predict the probability of moderate or severe bleaching as a function of key environmental variables derived from global-scale remote-sensing data. The ability of models to explain spatial and temporal variability in mass bleaching events was quantified. Results indicated approximately 20{\%} improved accuracy of predictions of bleaching when solar radiation and water mixing, in addition to elevated temperature, were incorporated into models, but predictive accuracy was variable among regions. Results provide insights into the effects of environmental parameters on bleaching at a global scale.},

  abstract = {Water resources globally are affected by a complex mixture of stressors resulting from a range of drivers, including urban and agricultural land use, hydropower generation and climate change. Understanding how stressors interfere and impact upon ecological status and ecosystem services is essential for developing effective River Basin Management Plans and shaping future environmental policy. This paper details the nature of these problems for Europe's water resources and the need to find solutions at a range of spatial scales. In terms of the latter, we describe the aims and approaches of the EU-funded project MARS (Managing Aquatic ecosystems and water Resources under multiple Stress) and the conceptual and analytical framework that it is adopting to provide this knowledge, understanding and tools needed to address multiple stressors. MARS is operating at three scales: At the water body scale, the mechanistic understanding of stressor interactions and their impact upon water resources, ecological status and ecosystem services will be examined through multi-factorial experiments and the analysis of long time-series. At the river basin scale, modelling and empirical approaches will be adopted to characterise relationships between multiple stressors and ecological responses, functions, services and water resources. The effects of future land use and mitigation scenarios in 16 European river basins will be assessed. At the European scale, large-scale spatial analysis will be carried out to identify the relationships amongst stress intensity, ecological status and service provision, with a special focus on large transboundary rivers, lakes and fish. The project will support managers and policy makers in the practical implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), of related legislation and of the Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources by advising the 3rd River Basin Management Planning cycle, the revision of the WFD and by developing new tools for diagnosing and predicting multiple stressors.},

  abstract = {When tropical systems lose species, they are often assumed to be buffered against declines in functional diversity by the ability of the species-rich biota to display high functional redundancy: i.e., a high number of species performing similar functions. We tested this hypothesis using a ninefold richness gradient in global fish faunas on tropical reefs encompassing 6,316 species distributed among 646 functional entities (FEs): i.e., unique combinations of functional traits. We found that the highest functional redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with a mean of 7.9 species per FE. However, this overall level of redundancy is disproportionately packed into few FEs, a pattern termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For instance, the most speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222 species (out of 3,689) whereas 38{\%} of FEs (180 out of 468) have no functional insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR is consistent across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever the richness, over a third of the species may still be in overrepresented FEs whereas more than one third of the FEs are left without insurance, these levels all being significantly higher than expected by chance. Thus, our study shows that, even in high-diversity systems, such as tropical reefs, functional diversity remains highly vulnerable to species loss. Although further investigations are needed to specifically address the influence of redundant vs. vulnerable FEs on ecosystem functioning, our results suggest that the promised benefits from tropical biodiversity may not be as strong as previously thought. fish ecology | coral reefs www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.131765111},

This requires an equal focus on managing for both natural and human dimensions of the protected estate. Consequently, identification of indicators that represent the human dimensions of Large Scale Marine Protected Areas (LSMPAs) such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is critical if these values are to be properly considered as part of standard management practice. Assessment and monitoring of the human dimensions of LSMPAs requires a replicable, collaborative process, rolled out at local scales but comparable across vast, socially and geographically diverse areas.

The process includes (a) development of a conceptual framework that links indicator sets to the desired state of the GBR{\&}{\#}039;s human dimensions; and (b) a collaborative approach including ten practical steps to implement assessment, monitoring, and benchmarking of the human dimensions of an LSMPA.

  abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a key threat to coral reefs by reducing the calcification rate of framework builders. In addition, acidification is likely to affect the relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates and the productivity of this association. However, little is known about how acidification impacts on the physiology of reef builders and how acidification interacts with warming. Here, we report on an 8-week study that compared bleaching, productivity, and calcification responses of crustose coralline algae (CCA) and branching (Acropora) and massive (Porites) coral species in response to acidification and warming. Using a 30-tank experimental system, we manipulated CO(2) levels to simulate doubling and three- to fourfold increases [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projection categories IV and VI] relative to present-day levels under cool and warm scenarios. Results indicated that high CO(2) is a bleaching agent for corals and CCA under high irradiance, acting synergistically with warming to lower thermal bleaching thresholds. We propose that CO(2) induces bleaching via its impact on photoprotective mechanisms of the photosystems. Overall, acidification impacted more strongly on bleaching and productivity than on calcification. Interestingly, the intermediate, warm CO(2) scenario led to a 30{\%} increase in productivity in Acropora, whereas high CO(2) lead to zero productivity in both corals. CCA were most sensitive to acidification, with high CO(2) leading to negative productivity and high rates of net dissolution. Our findings suggest that sensitive reef-building species such as CCA may be pushed beyond their thresholds for growth and survival within the next few decades whereas corals will show delayed and mixed responses.},

  abstract = {Massive declines in population abundances of marine animals have been documented over century-long time scales. However, analogous loss of spatial extent of habitat-forming organisms is less well known because georeferenced data are rare over long time scales, particularly in subtidal, tropical marine regions. We use high-resolution historical nautical charts to quantify changes to benthic structure over 240 years in the Florida Keys, finding an overall loss of 52{\%} (SE, 6.4{\%}) of the area of the seafloor occupied by corals. We find a strong spatial dimension to this decline; the spatial extent of coral in Florida Bay and nearshore declined by 87.5{\%} (SE, 7.2{\%}) and 68.8{\%} (SE, 7.5{\%}), respectively, whereas that of offshore areas of coral remained largely intact. These estimates add to finer-scale loss in live coral cover exceeding 90{\%} in some locations in recent decades. The near-complete elimination of the spatial coverage of nearshore coral represents an underappreciated spatial component of the shifting baseline syndrome, with important lessons for other species and ecosystems. That is, modern surveys are typically designed to assess change only within the species' known, extant range. For species ranging from corals to sea turtles, this approach may overlook spatial loss over longer time frames, resulting in both overly optimistic views of their current conservation status and underestimates of their restoration potential.},

@article{Smith2014,
  abstract = {Abstract. Ecosystems often experience multiple environmental stressors simultaneously that can differ widely in their pathways and strengths of impact. Differences in the relative impact of environmental stressors can guide restoration and management prioritization, but few studies have empirically assessed a comprehensive suite of stressors acting on a given ecosystem. To fill this gap in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where considerable restoration investments are currently underway, we used expert elicitation via a detailed online survey to develop ratings of the relative impacts of 50 potential stressors. Highlighting the multiplicity of stressors in this system, experts assessed all 50 stressors as having some impact on ecosystem condition, but ratings differed greatly among stressors. Individual stressors related to invasive and nuisance species (e.g., dreissenid mussels and ballast invasion risk) and climate change were assessed as having the greatest potential impacts. These results mark a shift away from the longstanding emphasis on nonpoint phosphorus and persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances in the Great Lakes. Differences in impact ratings among lakes and ecosystem zones were weak, and experts exhibited surprisingly high levels of agreement on the relative impacts of most stressors. Our results provide a basin-wide, quantitative summary of expert opinion on the present-day influence of all major Great Lakes stressors. The resulting ratings can facilitate prioritizing stressors to achieve management objectives in a given location, as well as providing a baseline for future stressor impact assessments in the Great Lakes and elsewhere.

@article{Teck2010,
  abstract = {As resource management and conservation efforts move toward multi-sector, ecosystem-based approaches, we need methods for comparing the varying responses of ecosystems to the impacts of human activities in order to prioritize management efforts, allocate limited resources, and understand cumulative effects. Given the number and variety of human activities affecting ecosystems, relatively few empirical studies are adequately comprehensive to inform these decisions. Consequently, management often turns to expert judgment for information. Drawing on methods from decision science, we offer a method for eliciting expert judgment to (1) quantitatively estimate the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, (2) help prioritize the management of stressors across multiple ecosystems, (3) evaluate how experts give weight to different criteria to characterize vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic stressors, and (4) identify key knowledge gaps. We applied this method to the California Current region in order to evaluate the relative vulnerability of 19 marine ecosystems to 53 stressors associated with human activities, based on surveys from 107 experts. When judging the relative vulnerability of ecosystems to stressors, we found that experts primarily considered two criteria: the ecosystem's resistance to the stressor and the number of species or trophic levels affected. Four intertidal ecosystems (mudflat, beach, salt marsh, and rocky intertidal) were judged most vulnerable to the suite of human activities evaluated here. The highest vulnerability rankings for coastal ecosystems were invasive species, ocean acidification, sea temperature change, sea level rise, and habitat alteration from coastal engineering, while offshore ecosystems were assessed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification, demersal destructive fishing, and shipwrecks. These results provide a quantitative, transparent, and repeatable assessment of relative vulnerability across ecosystems to any ongoing or emerging human activity. Combining these results with data on the spatial distribution and intensity of human activities provides a systematic foundation for ecosystem-based management.},

@article{Jones2016,
  abstract = {Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is a sub-discipline of environmental impact assessment that is concerned with appraising the collective effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment. Aspirations for CEA have been expressed by many authors since 1969, when the foundation of environmental appraisal was laid by the US National Environmental Policy Act. This paper's purposes are ( i) to review aspirations for CEA, relative to current practice; and ( ii) to fully explain and critique the logic that connects CEA's operational steps and underlying philosophies. A literature review supports the following statements: Some conceptualizations emphasize the delivery of information to support decision making as the key purpose of CEA; others deem collaboration, debate, and learning as most important. Consensus on CEA's operational steps has been reached, but each step requires practitioners to make analytical decisions (e.g., about the scope of issues to include or the time horizon to consider) and objective rules for how to approach those decisions are lacking. Numerical methods for assessing cumulative effects are largely available, meaning that CEA's biggest problems are not scientific. CEA cannot succeed without substantive public engagement, monitoring, and adaptive management. CEA is best undertaken regionally, rather than project-by-project. CEA and planning are complementary, and should be merged. In its most enlightened form, CEA is a useful tool for ensuring that human undertakings ultimately conform to Earth's finite biosphere, but current practice falls short of the ideal, and CEA's logical derivation is not entirely sound. As regards CEA's big problems, sustainability has not been defined clearly enough to make criteria for judging the significance of cumulative effects indisputable; legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks are poorly aligned for CEA; and objective criteria for judging the adequacy of CEA's scope, scale, and thresholds do not exist, which makes the question of how to provide general guidance to practitioners intractable. Recommendations call for sustainability goals to be clearly expressed as measurable targets. Furthermore, precaution in human enterprise should be exercised by avoiding, minimizing, restoring, and offsetting negative cumulative effects. CEA can assist by quantifying and optimizing trade-offs. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {The term cumulative effects assessment is frequently used yet the underlying principles and definitions are poorly specified. Consequently, there is no consistency or standardisation in approaches leaving marine managers and developers perplexed on how best to discharge their legal obligations to undertake cumulative effects assessment. This paper explores some of the origins of the terminology and re-interprets how these may best be applied to standardise the vocabulary and approaches to cumulative effects assessment.We define cumulative effects assessment as a systematic procedure for identifying and evaluating the significance of effects from multiple sources/activities and for providing an estimate on the overall expected impact to inform management measures. The analysis of the causes (source of pressures and effects), pathways and consequences of these effects on receptors is an essential and integral part of the process.Environmental risk assessment concepts, in particular sound problem formulation, have been used to provide a clear structure for cumulative effects assessment. We recommend that risk screening, prioritisation and evaluation should be a critical component of cumulative effects assessment to facilitate a filtering of the complex issues for consideration of the likelihood of exposure of receptors to pressures and the likelihood of a receptor responding to those pressures. This paper is intended to provide practical assistance to marine environmental impact assessment practitioners, marine environmental regulators and policy makers.},
