One important answer to this question is to in-form ecological risk assessment, that is, to provide a basis for assessing whether industrial and agricultural chemicals are likely to have adverse effects on ecosystems and hence provide a foundation for managing them. But ecotoxicology has evolved more from toxicology than ecology, and so there are those who argue that it is too simplistic to do the job effectively. This begs a number of questions that we shall address in this article: What kinds of adverse ecological effects are of concern in ecological risk assessment? How can we anticipate these effects to put into practice appropriate controls? How can we check the effectiveness of these approaches? Extrapolating the results of ecotoxicological tests to likely ecosystem effects undoubtedly involves a number of uncertainties. We shall discuss sources of these uncertainties and suggest ways that they might be addressed. Recent research suggests that there may be some general rules, which should increase our confidence in extrapolating results from simple to more complex ecological systems. However, there re-mains substantial room for improvement.},

Current approaches to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to aquatic ecosystems are developed for single stressors and determine stressor effects primarily as a function of stressor properties.

To meet the challenge of diagnosing and predicting multiple stressor impacts, assessment strategies should focus on properties of the biological receptors rather than on stressor properties. This change of paradigm is required because (i) multiple stressors affect multiple biological targets at multiple organizational levels, (ii) biological receptors differ in their sensitivities, vulnerabilities, and response dynamics to the individual stressors, and (iii) biological receptors function as networks, so that actions of stressors at disparate sites within the network can lea...},

In several marine regions, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea, legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem-based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20{\%} of the entire basin and 60-99{\%} of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted, with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1{\%} of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers, rather than one individual use or stressor, with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV, and acidification), demersal fishing, ship traffic, and, in coastal areas, pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems.},

Ecosystem health represents a desired endpoint of environmental management, but it requires adaptive, ongoing definition and assessment. We propose that a healthy ecosystem is one that is sustainable - that is, it has the ability to maintain its structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience). Various methods to quantify these three ecosystem attributes (vigor, organization, and resilience) are discussed. These attributes are then folded into a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health. A network analysis based ecosystem health assessment is developed and tested using trophic exchange networks representing several different aquatic ecosystems. Results indicate the potential of such an ecosystem health assessment for evaluating the relative health of similar ecosystems, and quantifying the effects of natural or anthropogenic stress on the health of a particular ecosystem over time.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Although the terms {\&}apos;health{\&}apos; and {\&}apos;healthy{\&}apos; are often applied to marine ecosystems and communicate information about holistic condition (e.g. as required by the Ecosystem Approach), their meaning is unclear. Ecosystems have been understood in various ways, from non-interacting populations of species to complex integrated systems. Health has been seen as a metaphor, an indicator that aggregates over system components, or a non-localized emergent system property. After a review, we define good ecosystem health as: {\&}apos;the condition of a system that is self-maintaining, vigorous, resilient to externally imposed pressures, and able to sustain services to humans. It contains healthy organisms and populations, and adequate functional diversity and functional response diversity. All expected trophic levels are present and well interconnected, and there is good spatial connectivity amongst subsystems.{\&}apos; We equate this condition with good ecological or environmental status, e.g. as referred to by recent EU Directives. Resilience is central to health, but difficult to measure directly. Ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure are at risk of losing resilience, and thus of suffering regime shifts and loss of services. For monitoring whole ecosystems, we propose an approach based on {\&}apos;trajectories in ecosystem state space{\&}apos;, illustrated with time-series from the northwestern North Sea. Change is visualized as Euclidian distance from an arbitrary reference state. Variability about a trend in distance is used as a proxy for inverse resilience. We identify the need for institutional support for long time-series to underpin this approach, and for research to establish state space co-ordinates for systems in good health. Changes in the northern North Sea, 1958-2008, plotted in a state space defined by the breeding success of kittiwakes, abundance of copepods Calanus spp., and simulated annual primary production.{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013. www.int-res.com.},

@article{Rapport1992,
  abstract = {In the past decade, metaphors drawn from human health are finding increasing application in environmental assessment at ecosystem levels. If ecosystem medicine is to come of age, it must cope with three fundamental dilemmas. The first stems from the recognition that there are no strictly objective criteria for judging health. Assessments of health, as in humans, inevitably are based on some combination of established norms and desirable attributes. The second stems from the irregular pulse of nature which either precludes the early recognition of substantive changes or gives rise to false alarms. The third is posed by the quest for indicators that have the attributes of being holistic, early warning, and diagnostic. Indicators that excel in one of these aspects, often fail in another. Advances in ecosystem medicine are likely to come from closer collaboration with medical colleagues in both clinical and epidemiological areas. In particular the time appears ripe for a more systematic effort to characterize ecosystem maladies, to validate treatments and to develop more sophisticated diagnostic protocols. These aspects are illustrated with comparisons drawn from studies of environmental transformation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, the Baltic Sea and Canadian terrestrial ecosystems.},

@incollection{Gaedke2009,
  abstract = {The species populations within an ecosystem can be organized according to feeding levels (trophic levels). Photoautotrophs, which produce organic matter from inorganic materials using solar energy, are the first level (algae, aquatic vascular plants). The second trophic level consists of herbivores, which also may be called grazers (including many types of zooplankton and other invertebrates). Herbivores are eaten by primary carnivores (carnivorous zooplankton and many fish). In some cases, a secondary carnivore level may also be very important (large fish that eat primary carnivores). A diagram of the feeding connections of all organisms in an ecosystem or part of an ecosystem is called a food web. The food web includes a grazer food chain, which passes from photoautotrophs to top carnivores. The food web also contains a detrital food chain, which is based on fecal matter, dead organisms, dissolved organic matter, and particulate matter coming from the watershed.  Often the trophic position of a species is intermediate between two trophic levels, because it feeds partially at one trophic level and partially at another trophic level. In this case, the species is assigned a fractional trophic level (e.g., 2.5). Species populations that have similar feeding and predation relationships sometimes are grouped together as trophic guilds for modeling purposes. The passage of energy or materials through a food web can be estimated from use of field data to calibrate a model showing the transfer of energy, carbon, or other substances through the food web. Efficiency of trophic transfer (proportion of energy or mass passed from one trophic level to the next) can be used in comparing food webs across ecosystems or within specific parts of an ecosystem. Trophic transfer efficiency may be related to physical conditions. In open water, for example, food chains tend to be longer because all plants are small and must be eaten by small herbivores, which support small carnivores that are eaten by large carnivores. Food-web analysis explains why some food webs are more efficient than others, and why some feeding levels suppress others. Thus, food-web analysis promotes an understanding of feeding relationships within ecosystems.},

Complex interactions within food webs may limit trophic cascades, and researchers have debated where trophic cascades are most likely to occur and their relative strength. Nevertheless, trophic cascades are widely observed in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in trophic cascades may shift systems to alternate states, and trophic cascades influence many processes, including biogeochemical cycling, crosshabitat linkages, and ecosystem services. Restoration of predators and resulting trophic cascades are important targets for conservation that can contribute to sustaining biodiversity.},

This primary production supports essentially all life in the oceans and profoundly affects global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This review discusses the general distribution of primary production in the sea, the processes that regulate this distribution, and how marine primary production is sensitive to climate variability and change. Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations. A paleoclimate record extends discussion to the centennial scale, providing contrasting insights into how marine primary production might vary in the future.},

  abstract = {The global carbon cycle is strongly controlled by the ocean because it is the largest carbon reservoir at the Earth surface and it absorbs 25{\%} of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The net ocean–atmosphere CO2 flux is controlled by a thermodynamic pump (CO2 solubility is higher when water get colder) and a biological pump (photosynthesis consumes CO2). Hence carbon is transferred from the surface ocean to the deep ocean by downwelling of cold and dense waters and by sinking of dead organic matter. In the surface ocean, the average dissolved CO2 concentration increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2. The buffering effect of carbonate system chemical equilibria amplifies carbon storage and reduces the lowering of the pH also called acidification. Elemental and isotopic tracers show that anthropic CO2 has invaded the thermocline and has started spreading in the deep Atlantic ocean with NADW and AABW.},

@article{Sammarco2013,
  abstract = {Increases in Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) as a result of global warming have caused reef-building scleractinian corals to bleach worldwide, a result of the loss of obligate endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Since the 1980's, bleaching severity and frequency has increased, in some cases causing mass mortality of corals. Earlier experiments have demonstrated that zooxanthellae in scleractinian corals from three families from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Faviidae, Poritidae, and Acroporidae) are more sensitive to heat stress than their hosts, exhibiting differential symptoms of programmed cell death - apoptosis and necrosis. Most zooxanthellar phylotypes are dying during expulsion upon release from the host. The host corals appear to be adapted or exapted to the heat increases. We attempt to determine whether this adaptation/exaptation occurs in octocorals by examining the heat-sensitivities of zooxanthellae and their host octocoral alcyonacean soft corals - Sarcophyton ehrenbergi (Alcyoniidae), Sinularia lochmodes (Alcyoniidae), and Xenia elongata (Xeniidae), species from two different families. The soft coral holobionts were subjected to experimental seawater temperatures of 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36°C for 48 hrs. Host and zooxanthellar cells were examined for viability, apoptosis, and necrosis (in hospite and expelled) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescent microscopy (FM), and flow cytometry (FC). As experimental temperatures increased, zooxanthellae generally exhibited apoptotic and necrotic symptoms at lower temperatures than host cells and were expelled. Responses varied species-specifically. Soft coral hosts were adapted/exapted to higher seawater temperatures than their zooxanthellae. As with the scleractinians, the zooxanthellae appear to be the limiting factor for survival of the holobiont in the groups tested, in this region. These limits have now been shown to operate in six species within five families and two orders of the Cnidaria in the western Pacific. We hypothesize that this relationship may have taxonomic implications for other obligate zooxanthellate cnidarians subject to bleaching.},

Conversely, some toxic chemicals modify the exposure of aquatic species to other stressors by affecting species distribution, behaviour or habitat. Across Canada there are a number of specific examples where interactions between contaminants and environmental change are probably harming aquatic species.

  abstract = {Environmental change can increase the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals by challenging an organism's aptitude to respond to chemicals or to repair toxic injury or by modifying animal behaviours like migration or predation. On the other hand, xenobiotics may affect the capacity of aquatic species to adapt to environmental chal-lenges that come with change (e.g., pathogens, temperature). Across Canada we have identified a number of circumstan-ces where chemicals and environmental variability have likely worked together to affect vulnerability of aquatic organisms. For example in the Maritimes, exposure to municipal wastewater or bleached kraft pulp mill effluent altered immune function in bivalves and increased their risk of developing haemocytic neoplasia, a disease known to cause high mortality. Northwest Atlantic cod stocks have experienced large-scale changes in environment and exhibit marked seasonal cycles in energy reserves. The risk associated with subsequent redistribution of persistent chemicals in the body together with nutritional deficiency is presently under evaluation since it could affect the recovery of these endan-gered stocks. In the Great Lakes, the introduction of an invasive fish species, the alewife, modified the diet of salmo-nids, which led to a deficiency of the vitamin thiamine in eggs causing early mortality. Contaminants may interact with thiamine deficiency and thus critically impair recruitment of salmonids. Viewing the risks presented by toxic chemicals from the point of view of species vulnerability, offers managers opportunities to mitigate such risks, for example, through habitat, ocean and fisheries management. Further research is needed to develop biomarkers of vulnerability, identify most vulnerable life stages and populations, to understand the interactions between global environmental changes, nutritional status, pathogens and toxic chemicals, and to develop integrated approaches to manage vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to toxic chemicals.

@article{Hooper2013,
  abstract = {Incorporation of global climate change (GCC) effects into assessments of chemical risk and injury requires integrated examinations of chemical and nonchemical stressors. Environmental variables altered by GCC (temperature, precipitation, salinity, pH) can influence the toxicokinetics of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion as well as toxicodynamic interactions between chemicals and target molecules. In addition, GCC challenges processes critical for coping with the external environment (water balance, thermoregulation, nutrition, and the immune, endocrine, and neurological systems), leaving organisms sensitive to even slight perturbations by chemicals when pushed to the limits of their physiological tolerance range. In simplest terms, GCC can make organisms more sensitive to chemical stressors, while alternatively, exposure to chemicals can make organisms more sensitive to GCC stressors. One challenge is to identify potential interactions between nonchemical and chemical stressors affecting key physiological processes in an organism. We employed adverse outcome pathways, constructs depicting linkages between mechanism-based molecular initiating events and impacts on individuals or populations, to assess how chemical- and climate-specific variables interact to lead to adverse outcomes. Case examples are presented for prospective scenarios, hypothesizing potential chemicalGCC interactions, and retrospective scenarios, proposing mechanisms for demonstrated chemicalclimate interactions in natural populations. Understanding GCC interactions along adverse outcome pathways facilitates extrapolation between species or other levels of organization, development of hypotheses and focal areas for further research, and improved inputs for risk and resource injury assessments.

@article{Paine1998,
  abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of distur- bance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Conse- quently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturba- tions within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physi- cally based disturbance (for example, storm, volca- nic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dis- persal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that de- scribe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ‘‘ecological surprises.'' In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state.We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthro- pogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century. Key},

  abstract = {The number of combinations of anthropogenic stressors affecting global change is increasing; however, few studies have empirically tested for their interactive effects on ecosystems. Most importantly, interactions among ecological stressors generate nonadditive effects that cannot be easily predicted based on single-stressor studies. Here, we corroborate findings from an in situ mesocosm experiment with evidence from a whole-ecosystem manipulation to demonstrate for the first time that interactions between climate and acidification determine their cumulative impact on the food-web structure of coldwater lakes. Interactions among warming, drought, and acidification, rather than the sum of their individual effects, best explained significant changes in planktonic consumer and producer biomass over a 23-year period. Further, these stressors interactively exerted significant synergistic and antagonistic effects on consumers and producers, respectively. The observed prevalence of long- and short-term ecological surprises involving the cumulative impacts of multiple anthropogenic stressors highlights the high degree of uncertainty surrounding current forecasts of the consequences of global change.},

@article{Gutt2015a,
  abstract = {A quantitative assessment of observed and projected environmental changes in the Southern Ocean (SO) with a potential impact on the marine ecosystem shows: (i) large proportions of the SO are and will be affected by one or more climate change processes; areas projected to be affected in the future are larger than areas that are already under environmental stress, (ii) areas affected by changes in sea-ice in the past and likely in the future are much larger than areas affected by ocean warming. The smallest areas ({\textless}1{\%} area of the SO) are affected by glacier retreat and warming in the deeper euphotic layer. In the future, decrease in the sea-ice is expected to be widespread. Changes in iceberg impact resulting from further collapse of ice-shelves can potentially affect large parts of shelf and ephemerally in the off-shore regions. However, aragonite undersaturation (acidification) might become one of the biggest problems for the Antarctic marine ecosystem by affecting almost the entire SO. Direct and indirect impacts of various environmen- tal changes to the three major habitats, sea-ice, pelagic and benthos and their biota are complex. The areas affected by environmental stressors range from 33{\%} of the SO for a single stressor, 11{\%} for two and 2{\%} for three, to {\textless}1{\%} for four and five overlapping factors. In the future, areas expected to be affected by 2 and 3 overlapping factors are equally large, including potential iceberg changes, and together cover almost 86{\%} of the SO ecosystem.},

These complexities have challenged the use and utility of threshold concepts in environmental management despite great concern about prevent-ing dramatic state changes in valued ecosystems, the need for determining critical pollutant loads and the ubiquity of other threshold-based envi-ronmental problems. In this paper we define the scope of the thresholds concept in ecological sci-ence and discuss methods for identifying and investigating thresholds using a variety of examples from terrestrial and aquatic environments, at eco-system, landscape and regional scales.

@article{Porter1999,
  abstract = {Changes in land use and water management practices in south Florida have altered the quality and quantity of freshwater flowing into Florida Bay. By the 1980s, reduced inflow and drought led to an extensive hypersaline phase in the bay. This phase had a drastic effect on benthic communities within the bay and possibly also on coral communities within the bay and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Physical oceanographic measurements demonstrate the presence of warm, hypersaline, and turbid water on coral reefs offshore from the Florida Keys, especially near passes which conduct water from Florida Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. To examine the effect of Florida Bay water intrusions on coral reefs, we tested for significant effects of two stressors, elevated temperature and salinity, on coral production, respiration, and survival. Elevated temperatures produce significant reductions in photosynthesis, respiration, and net P:R ratios after 6 h of exposure, and elevated salinities produce similar results after 30 h. Exposure to both elevated temperature and salinity produces a highly significant (P {\textgreater} 0.01), but short-term, mitigative interactive effect. The combination of the two stressors was less stressful (for the response variables measured) than the sum of the stressors acting independently. After 36 h of exposure, however, the mitigating effect disappeared and corals exposed to the combined stresses did not survive. A three-dimensional response surface, which predicts P: R ratios as a function of varying salinity and temperature, is used to construct a testable hypothesis to explain recent declines in coral cover on some reefs within Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. We chose salinity and temperature to test a multiple stressor model because they are relatively easy to manipulate. However, any environmentally realistic model must include other potential stressors, such as turbidity, elevated nutrients, and environmental contaminants.},

@article{Crain2008,
  abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26{\%}), synergistic (36{\%}), and antagonistic (38{\%}). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

@article{Halpern2007,
  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are threatened by a suite of anthropogenic stressors. Mitigating multiple threats is a daunting task, particularly when funding constraints limit the number of threats that can be addressed. Threats are typically assessed and prioritized via expert opinion workshops that often leave no record of the rationale for decisions, making it difficult to update recommendations with new information. We devised a transparent, repeatable, and modifiable method for collecting expert opinion that describes and documents how threats affect marine ecosystems. Experts were asked to assess the functional impact, scale, and frequency of a threat to an ecosystem; the resistance and recovery time of an ecosystem to a threat; and the certainty of these estimates. To quantify impacts of 38 distinct anthropogenic threats on 23 marine ecosystems, we surveyed 135 experts from 19 different countries. Survey results showed that all ecosystems are threatened by at least nine threats and that nine ecosystems are threatened by {\textgreater}90{\%} of existing threats. The greatest threats (highest impact scores) were increasing sea temperature, demersal destructive fishing, and point-source organic pollution. Rocky reef, coral reef, hard-shelf, mangrove, and offshore epipelagic ecosystems were identified as the most threatened. These general results, however, may be partly influenced by the specific expertise and geography of respondents, and should be interpreted with caution. This approach to threat analysis can identify the greatest threats (globally or locally), most widespread threats, most (or least) sensitive ecosystems, most (or least) threatened ecosystems, and other metrics of conservation value. Additionally, it can be easily modified, updated as new data become available, and scaled to local or regional settings, which would facilitate informed and transparent conservation priority setting.},

Increasing evidence shows that the critical climate level for such collapse may be altered by conditions that can be managed locally.

@article{Hattam2015,
  abstract = {There is a multitude of ecosystem service classifications available within the literature, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. Elements of them have been used to tailor a generic ecosystem service classification for the marine environment and then for a case study site within the North Sea: the Dogger Bank. Indicators for each of the ecosystem services, deemed relevant to the case study site, were identified. Each indicator was then assessed against a set of agreed criteria to ensure its relevance and applicability to environmental management. This paper identifies the need to distinguish between indicators of ecosystem services that are entirely ecological in nature (and largely reveal the potential of an ecosystem to provide ecosystem services), indicators for the ecological processes contributing to the delivery of these services, and indicators of benefits that reveal the realized human use or enjoyment of an ecosystem service. It highlights some of the difficulties faced in selecting meaningful indicators, such as problems of specificity, spatial disconnect and the considerable uncertainty about marine species, habitats and the processes, functions and services they contribute to.},

The aim of this paper, conducted by the Benthos Ecology Working Group of ICES, is to describe how the principles have been translated, which were the challenges and best way forward. We have tackled the following principles: the ecosystem-based approach, the development of benthic indicators, the definition of 'pristine' or sustainable conditions, the detection of pressures and the development of monitoring programs. We concluded that testing and integrating the different approaches was facilitated during the WFD process, which led to further insights and improvements, which the MSFD can rely upon.

  abstract = {Climate change is unambiguous and its effects are clearly detected in all functional units of the Earth system. This study presents new analyses of sea-surface temperature changes and show that climate change is affecting ecosystems of the North Atlantic. Changes are seen from phytoplankton to zooplankton to fish and are modifying the dominance of species and the structure, the diversity and the functioning of marine ecosystems. Changes also range from phenological to biogeographical shifts and have involved in some regions of the Atlantic abrupt ecosystem shifts. These alterations reflect a response of pelagic ecosystems to a warmer temperature regime. Mechanisms are complex because they are nonlinear exhibiting tipping points and varying in space and time. Sensitivity of organisms to temperature changes is high, implicating that a small temperature modification can have sustained ecosystem effects. Implications of these changes for biogeochemical cycles are discussed. Two observed changes detected in the North Sea that could have opposite effects on carbon cycle are discussed. Increase in phytoplankton, as inferred from the phytoplankton colour index derived from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey, has been detected in the North Sea. This pattern has been accompanied by a reduction in the abundance of the herbivorous species Calanus finmarchicus. This might have reduced the grazing pressure and increase diatomaceous 'fluff', therefore carbon export in the North Sea. Therefore, it could be argued that the biological carbon pump might increase in this region with sea warming. In the meantime, however, the mean size of organisms (calanoid copepods) has dropped. Such changes have implications for the turnover time of biogenic carbon in plankton organisms and the mean residence time of particulate carbon they produce. The system characterising the warmer period is more based on recycling and less on export. The increase in the minimum turnover time indicates an increase in the ecosystem metabolism, which can be considered as a response of the pelagic ecosystems to climate warming. This phenomenon could reduce carbon export. These two opposite patterns of change are examples of the diversity of mechanisms and pathways the ecosystems may exhibit with climate change. Oversimplification of current biogeochemical models, often due to lack of data and biological understanding, could lead to wrong projection on the direction ecosystems and therefore some biogeochemical cycles might take in a warmer world. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

@article{Dauvin2007,
  abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive will have instituted the concept of Ecological Quality Status (EQS) as a way to assess the biological quality of water masses. The EQS will be based mainly upon the composition of the different biological compartments in the ecosystem specially the benthos as compared to certain reference sites. Such management tools are already well established for freshwater (i.e. biotic indices), but not for coastal and estuarine (i.e. transitional) waters. In the framework of the Seine-Aval programme a workshop on benthic indicators was organized at Wimereux (France) in June 2005. The aim of this workshop and this paper is (1) to present the experiences of the Seine Aval researchers, and the French scientific approaches to benthic indicators, with those international experiences and approaches that have been published or are under development; and (2) to examine the existing benthic tools and their possible use in the characterization of the state of estuarine ecosystems. The debate during the workshop and the numerous recently published on the WFD are discussed in term of the implementation of the WFD in transitional water bodies using benthic indicators and indices. Some proposals for the future underline the needs to re-examine and adapt the different index thresholds, to take into account physical disturbances, to inventory the existing conditions vs reference conditions and to be as pragmatic as possible in using the WFD in transitional waters. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Elliott2007,
  abstract = {Estuaries have long been regarded as environmentally naturally stressed areas because of the high degree of variability in their physico-chemical characteristics, for example oxygen, temperature and salinity in the water column and bed sediment dynamics. However, their biota is well-adapted to cope with that stress and so the areas may be regarded as resilient because of that inherent variability; their ability to absorb stress without adverse effects is regarded here as Environmental Homeostasis. Hence these areas may only be regarded as stressful for marine or freshwater-adapted organisms and that for estuarine organisms this environmental stress is regarded as a subsidy whereby they successfully capitalise on the stressful conditions. In addition, using examples of the estuarine fauna and flora, this article indicates that the characteristics of natural stress in estuaries are similar to those for anthropogenic stress. An over-reliance on ecosystem structural features, such as diversity, in quality indicators therefore makes the detection of the anthropogenic stress more difficult. This difficulty is termed the Estuarine Quality Paradox. Because of these difficulties, the article argues that functional characteristics either as well as or rather than structural ones should be used in detecting environmental perturbations in estuaries. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
