One important answer to this question is to in-form ecological risk assessment, that is, to provide a basis for assessing whether industrial and agricultural chemicals are likely to have adverse effects on ecosystems and hence provide a foundation for managing them. But ecotoxicology has evolved more from toxicology than ecology, and so there are those who argue that it is too simplistic to do the job effectively. This begs a number of questions that we shall address in this article: What kinds of adverse ecological effects are of concern in ecological risk assessment? How can we anticipate these effects to put into practice appropriate controls? How can we check the effectiveness of these approaches? Extrapolating the results of ecotoxicological tests to likely ecosystem effects undoubtedly involves a number of uncertainties. We shall discuss sources of these uncertainties and suggest ways that they might be addressed. Recent research suggests that there may be some general rules, which should increase our confidence in extrapolating results from simple to more complex ecological systems. However, there re-mains substantial room for improvement.},

Current approaches to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to aquatic ecosystems are developed for single stressors and determine stressor effects primarily as a function of stressor properties. The cumulative impact of several stressors, however, may differ markedly from the impact of the single stressors and can result in nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. To meet the challenge of diagnosing and predicting multiple stressor impacts, assessment strategies should focus on properties of the biological receptors rather than on stressor properties. This change of paradigm is required because (i) multiple stressors affect multiple biological targets at multiple organizational levels, (ii) biological receptors differ in their sensitivities, vulnerabilities, and response dynamics to the individual stressors, and (iii) biological receptors function as networks, so that actions of stressors at disparate sites within the network can lea...},

In several marine regions, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea, legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem-based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20{\%} of the entire basin and 60-99{\%} of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted, with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1{\%} of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers, rather than one individual use or stressor, with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV, and acidification), demersal fishing, ship traffic, and, in coastal areas, pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems.},

Ecosystem health represents a desired endpoint of environmental management, but it requires adaptive, ongoing definition and assessment. We propose that a healthy ecosystem is one that is sustainable - that is, it has the ability to maintain its structure (organization) and function (vigor) over time in the face of external stress (resilience). Various methods to quantify these three ecosystem attributes (vigor, organization, and resilience) are discussed. These attributes are then folded into a comprehensive assessment of ecosystem health. A network analysis based ecosystem health assessment is developed and tested using trophic exchange networks representing several different aquatic ecosystems. Results indicate the potential of such an ecosystem health assessment for evaluating the relative health of similar ecosystems, and quantifying the effects of natural or anthropogenic stress on the health of a particular ecosystem over time.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Although the terms {\&}apos;health{\&}apos; and {\&}apos;healthy{\&}apos; are often applied to marine ecosystems and communicate information about holistic condition (e.g. as required by the Ecosystem Approach), their meaning is unclear. Ecosystems have been understood in various ways, from non-interacting populations of species to complex integrated systems. Health has been seen as a metaphor, an indicator that aggregates over system components, or a non-localized emergent system property. After a review, we define good ecosystem health as: {\&}apos;the condition of a system that is self-maintaining, vigorous, resilient to externally imposed pressures, and able to sustain services to humans. It contains healthy organisms and populations, and adequate functional diversity and functional response diversity. All expected trophic levels are present and well interconnected, and there is good spatial connectivity amongst subsystems.{\&}apos; We equate this condition with good ecological or environmental status, e.g. as referred to by recent EU Directives. Resilience is central to health, but difficult to measure directly. Ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure are at risk of losing resilience, and thus of suffering regime shifts and loss of services. For monitoring whole ecosystems, we propose an approach based on {\&}apos;trajectories in ecosystem state space{\&}apos;, illustrated with time-series from the northwestern North Sea. Change is visualized as Euclidian distance from an arbitrary reference state. Variability about a trend in distance is used as a proxy for inverse resilience. We identify the need for institutional support for long time-series to underpin this approach, and for research to establish state space co-ordinates for systems in good health. Changes in the northern North Sea, 1958-2008, plotted in a state space defined by the breeding success of kittiwakes, abundance of copepods Calanus spp., and simulated annual primary production.{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013. www.int-res.com.},

@article{Rapport1992,
  abstract = {In the past decade, metaphors drawn from human health are finding increasing application in environmental assessment at ecosystem levels. If ecosystem medicine is to come of age, it must cope with three fundamental dilemmas. The first stems from the recognition that there are no strictly objective criteria for judging health. Assessments of health, as in humans, inevitably are based on some combination of established norms and desirable attributes. The second stems from the irregular pulse of nature which either precludes the early recognition of substantive changes or gives rise to false alarms. The third is posed by the quest for indicators that have the attributes of being holistic, early warning, and diagnostic. Indicators that excel in one of these aspects, often fail in another. Advances in ecosystem medicine are likely to come from closer collaboration with medical colleagues in both clinical and epidemiological areas. In particular the time appears ripe for a more systematic effort to characterize ecosystem maladies, to validate treatments and to develop more sophisticated diagnostic protocols. These aspects are illustrated with comparisons drawn from studies of environmental transformation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, the Baltic Sea and Canadian terrestrial ecosystems.},

@incollection{Gaedke2009,
  abstract = {The species populations within an ecosystem can be organized according to feeding levels (trophic levels). Photoautotrophs, which produce organic matter from inorganic materials using solar energy, are the first level (algae, aquatic vascular plants). The second trophic level consists of herbivores, which also may be called grazers (including many types of zooplankton and other invertebrates). Herbivores are eaten by primary carnivores (carnivorous zooplankton and many fish). In some cases, a secondary carnivore level may also be very important (large fish that eat primary carnivores). A diagram of the feeding connections of all organisms in an ecosystem or part of an ecosystem is called a food web. The food web includes a grazer food chain, which passes from photoautotrophs to top carnivores. The food web also contains a detrital food chain, which is based on fecal matter, dead organisms, dissolved organic matter, and particulate matter coming from the watershed.  Often the trophic position of a species is intermediate between two trophic levels, because it feeds partially at one trophic level and partially at another trophic level. In this case, the species is assigned a fractional trophic level (e.g., 2.5). Species populations that have similar feeding and predation relationships sometimes are grouped together as trophic guilds for modeling purposes. The passage of energy or materials through a food web can be estimated from use of field data to calibrate a model showing the transfer of energy, carbon, or other substances through the food web. Efficiency of trophic transfer (proportion of energy or mass passed from one trophic level to the next) can be used in comparing food webs across ecosystems or within specific parts of an ecosystem. Trophic transfer efficiency may be related to physical conditions. In open water, for example, food chains tend to be longer because all plants are small and must be eaten by small herbivores, which support small carnivores that are eaten by large carnivores. Food-web analysis explains why some food webs are more efficient than others, and why some feeding levels suppress others. Thus, food-web analysis promotes an understanding of feeding relationships within ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Trophic cascades are the effects of predators on prey that propagate down food webs. They cause inverse patterns of abundance and biomass among trophic groups. Complex interactions within food webs may limit trophic cascades, and researchers have debated where trophic cascades are most likely to occur and their relative strength. Nevertheless, trophic cascades are widely observed in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Changes in trophic cascades may shift systems to alternate states, and trophic cascades influence many processes, including biogeochemical cycling, crosshabitat linkages, and ecosystem services. Restoration of predators and resulting trophic cascades are important targets for conservation that can contribute to sustaining biodiversity.},

Species are often studied in pairs or small groups to examine competition, predation, and mutualism. To reflect more species and therefore more interactions, ecologists characterize food webs and metacommunities.

  abstract = {Marine photosynthetic plankton are responsible for approximately 50 petagrams (1015) of carbon per year of net primary production, an amount equivalent to that on land. This primary production supports essentially all life in the oceans and profoundly affects global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This review discusses the general distribution of primary production in the sea, the processes that regulate this distribution, and how marine primary production is sensitive to climate variability and change. Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations. A paleoclimate record extends discussion to the centennial scale, providing contrasting insights into how marine primary production might vary in the future.},

  abstract = {The global carbon cycle is strongly controlled by the ocean because it is the largest carbon reservoir at the Earth surface and it absorbs 25{\%} of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The net ocean–atmosphere CO2 flux is controlled by a thermodynamic pump (CO2 solubility is higher when water get colder) and a biological pump (photosynthesis consumes CO2). Hence carbon is transferred from the surface ocean to the deep ocean by downwelling of cold and dense waters and by sinking of dead organic matter. In the surface ocean, the average dissolved CO2 concentration increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2. The buffering effect of carbonate system chemical equilibria amplifies carbon storage and reduces the lowering of the pH also called acidification. Elemental and isotopic tracers show that anthropic CO2 has invaded the thermocline and has started spreading in the deep Atlantic ocean with NADW and AABW.},

@article{Sammarco2013,
  abstract = {Increases in Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) as a result of global warming have caused reef-building scleractinian corals to bleach worldwide, a result of the loss of obligate endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. Since the 1980's, bleaching severity and frequency has increased, in some cases causing mass mortality of corals. Earlier experiments have demonstrated that zooxanthellae in scleractinian corals from three families from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Faviidae, Poritidae, and Acroporidae) are more sensitive to heat stress than their hosts, exhibiting differential symptoms of programmed cell death - apoptosis and necrosis. Most zooxanthellar phylotypes are dying during expulsion upon release from the host. The host corals appear to be adapted or exapted to the heat increases. We attempt to determine whether this adaptation/exaptation occurs in octocorals by examining the heat-sensitivities of zooxanthellae and their host octocoral alcyonacean soft corals - Sarcophyton ehrenbergi (Alcyoniidae), Sinularia lochmodes (Alcyoniidae), and Xenia elongata (Xeniidae), species from two different families. The soft coral holobionts were subjected to experimental seawater temperatures of 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36°C for 48 hrs. Host and zooxanthellar cells were examined for viability, apoptosis, and necrosis (in hospite and expelled) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fluorescent microscopy (FM), and flow cytometry (FC). As experimental temperatures increased, zooxanthellae generally exhibited apoptotic and necrotic symptoms at lower temperatures than host cells and were expelled. Responses varied species-specifically. Soft coral hosts were adapted/exapted to higher seawater temperatures than their zooxanthellae. As with the scleractinians, the zooxanthellae appear to be the limiting factor for survival of the holobiont in the groups tested, in this region. These limits have now been shown to operate in six species within five families and two orders of the Cnidaria in the western Pacific. We hypothesize that this relationship may have taxonomic implications for other obligate zooxanthellate cnidarians subject to bleaching.},
