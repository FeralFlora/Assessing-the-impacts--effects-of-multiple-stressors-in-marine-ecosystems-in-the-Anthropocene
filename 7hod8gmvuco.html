<div></div><div><b>7</b><b>.</b>&nbsp;<b>Describing the combined effect of the stressors and taking into account their potential interactions</b></div><div>+++++ AOP to identify the interactions</div><div>The interactions between stressors in the Great Barrier Reef were identified in the step coming before, but it is still not clear whether they are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. To solve this matter, simulated additive effects between all the interacting stressors are calculated. The method to assess additive effects, which are the sum of the single ones, is found in the following paper:&nbsp;<i>Synergistic impacts of global warming on the resilience of coral reefs</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite>. Then, the expectation is compared with the reality. If the results match or are similar, then the interaction is additive. On the other hand, if the response is considerably higher, means that the combined stressors act synergistic, and, if it is lower, the interaction is antagonistic. An example that shows the complexity of this assessment is the mutual effects caused by ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperature. While the interaction between these two stressors on the dissolution of carbonate in coral reefs is antagonistic&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Trnovsky2016}</cite>, what is positive to coral's health, they can also interact synergistically making corals more susceptible to bleaching.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Anthony2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>8. </b></div><div>This conceptual framework found in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Pendleton_2016}</cite>&nbsp;describes the ecological processes that contribute to coral reef growth and maintenance vs. the biological and anthropogenic factors that can work against these processes. Illustrating in general terms some of the reef main constituents species, the ecosystem features important to people, it then highlights the reverse in balance of calcification and decalcification taking place in the Anthropocene. Although this model gives an idea of the stressors and their effect on the reef, it fails to show the cumulative interactions explained in the previous step.&nbsp;</div>
