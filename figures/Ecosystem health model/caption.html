<div data-label="305723">A systems conceptualization of ecosystem health. Ecosystem components (biota, their non-living environment, and trophic and biogeochemical fluxes) are suggested by the white network. Overlying this are the high-level ‘internal descriptors’ of system state: organization and vigour. These are responsible for the external property of resilience, which buffers ecosystem state and services against externally imposed (anthropogenic) pressures and other boundary fluxes, thus maintaining system integrity. Health describes the ability to maintain systems integrity, and it and resilience are emergent properties of the system; they cannot be localized into any particular component. At the left are listed the attributes of organization that are thought to contribute to resilience. Components of vigour are shown at the base of the ecosystem box. To the right is shown the matching human system, which together with the ecosystem, makes up a social-ecological system. Only endogenous pressures—those generated within this system—are shown.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite></div>
