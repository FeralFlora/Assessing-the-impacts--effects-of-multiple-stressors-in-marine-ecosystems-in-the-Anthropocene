<div data-label="578439">(a) Current restoration paradigm where the recovery trajectory&nbsp;(solid grey line and arrow) is often assumed to match the trajectory of biodiversity decline (solid black line and arrow). Anthropocene Baselines (ABs; black dashed lines) apply when the restoration potential is outside of the historical baseline (HB; the black box) range of ecological variability. Type I ABs (b) arise because of socioeconomic limits on reducing anthropogenic pressure; type II ABs (c) arise when the maximum anthropogenic pressure reduction (MAPR) is expected to return the system to an HB but internal ecological constraints and feedback mechanisms alter the restoration trajectory. Type II ABs represent a state change across a catastrophic threshold&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2001,Scheffer2009}</cite>, whereas type I ABs may arise without a state change.</div>
