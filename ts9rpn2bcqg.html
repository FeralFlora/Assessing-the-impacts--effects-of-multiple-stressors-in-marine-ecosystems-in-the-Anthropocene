Since non of these methods was able  to provide a complete assessment individually, their combination was chosen.  This union is done by using the strengths of every method and ruling out the  weaknesses, which are determined by the preceding section of&nbsp;<b><i>judgement blabla*</i></b>.&nbsp; Moreover, the steps presented in the table follow a logical order according to the information required in every time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>The first step is taken primarily from theOnly the second step,  define a baseline, has no inspiration in any mentioned paper.&nbsp;</div><div>            </div><div>            </div>
