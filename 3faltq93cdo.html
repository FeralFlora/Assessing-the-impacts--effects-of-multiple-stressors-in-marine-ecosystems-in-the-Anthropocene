<div>So the often found too narrowly research of scientists, concentrating only on one or a few stressor(s), gives us a great detailed knowledge about their used tools. Furthermore, they make specific predictions about future perspectives of ecosystem adaptions. Using this knowledge and modifying the tools for assessing these univariate stressors to assess multivariate stressors, one can get a realistic picture of the cumulative effects and the different stressors interacting to make reasonable predictions for the future development of these ecosystems.</div>
