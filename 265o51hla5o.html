As we have framed the focus of our project at the ecosystem level, the methods we are interested in should facilitate assessment of cumulative impacts at this level, rather than only provide insights into population or community level impacts and changes. But what exactly is understood by impacts assessments at an ecosystem level, and are such assessments within scientific reach? To assess ecosystem level impacts, it may well be necessary to approach the assessment with a tiered strategy that ends at an ecosystem assessment, but is conducted through stepwise considerations of specific ecosystem components, so  although a specific methodology isn't an ecosystem level impact assessment in and of itself, it may yet be an integral part of the big picture. These questions and considerations will now be addressed.</div><div>As exhaustively explained, the impacts on a specific species' population infer potential impacts on the community it is part of, which then infers potential impacts upon the functioning, structure and stability of the ecosystem the community is part of. Simultaneously, impacts on ecosystem functioning and environmental conditions infer potential impacts on the communities within the ecosystem and the populations that comprise these communities. Although explained by order of complexity, these perturbations may follow more chaotic or unpredictable impact pathways, and may occur in several directions at the same time. Thus, a multifaceted insight into the relationships, dynamics, processes and impact pathways between these various organisational levels and ecosystem components is necessary. The main question, then, is whether or not any particular assessment approach is sufficiently developed to account for the multitude of variables and insights to account for in order to predict or describe multiple stressor outcomes&nbsp; - without ignoring the complexities of stressor interactions, dynamic processes and non-linear responses. If not, which might be likely, the best current multiple stressor impact assessment at the ecosystem level might be a toolbox of select tools for specific sub-assessments, which, when properly combined, provide an ecosystem level overview of the impacts of multiple stressors.</div><div>For ecosystem level assessments to be viable and valuable (informative and predictive or early-warning), the applied methods must be able to reflect conditions and changes at this level. That is, they must strike the aforementioned balance between pragmatic practicality and sufficient accuracy and sophistication in the sense of an optimal limitation of uncertainties from misrepresentative assumptions.</div><div>For the use of indexes and indicators, these can be used either as a diagnostic or "indicative" aid, whereby the selected metrics provide insights to be analysed further, or, when deemed sufficiently representative of the state of the assessed ecosystem, as assessment methods by themselves. This latter approach can represent the "universal metric" approach, in contrast to modelling, for example. The applicability of indicators depends on their specific suitability for the ecosystem at hand and the ecological considerations and priorities which guide the management efforts related to the assessment.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja2009,Rombouts2013a}</cite></div><div>Our conclusion on this matter is that the ecosystem level approach is not only a scientific ideal, but is instead central to any understanding of the multiple stressor issue, since it is at this level that the surprising effects, which we want to understand so as to make them not be surprises anymore, arise.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halll}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Martinez-Crego2010}</cite></div><div><b>Applicability of models&nbsp;</b></div><div>Ecological risk assessment on the system scale: A review of state-of-the-art models and future perspectives</div><div></div><div>?<b> IMPACT DEFINITION</b>&nbsp;?</div><div>"The challenges and opportunities in cumulative effects assessment" page 128 and column 4 in recommended steps</div><div></div><div><b>DISCUSS TABLE</b></div><div><b>DISCUSS STEPS using Case Study</b></div><div><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ESPECIALLY STEP NINE</b></div><div></div><div><b>MODEL AND METHOD VALIDATIONS</b> (<b>mesocosm studies, predicting historical changes / events etc.</b>)   &nbsp;</div>
