<h3 data-label="360794" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">4. Present drivers</h3><div>The coral ecosystem map from the previous step has established a functional ecological understanding to guide the rest of the assessment. From this point on, we can begin to create an overview of the present drivers, defined as underlying causes of change (either positive or negative) in the environment (Outlook Report, 2014). Respectively, a driver is a factor that creates stressors, and the stressors, in turn, are the specific effects (arising from the driver) that cause stress. A single driver may cause several stressors, which may interact. For the purposes of the "Reef 2050 Integrated Monitoring and Reporting Program" the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority propose six broad drivers that influence pressure on and change of the Great Barrier Reef:</div><ol><li>Climate change</li><li>Population growth</li><li>Economic growth</li><li>Technological developments</li><li>Societal attitudes</li><li>Governance systems</li></ol><div>Whilst informative about the underlying factors that influence trends in societal activity levels and the resultant environmental pressures, these categories are quite coarse and don't directly inform the assessment about the regionally present drivers, as defined above. Thus, each broad driver can be further specified to inform the assessment of present drivers such as anthropogenic inputs of agricultural nutrients and xenobiotics or novel entities, sediments from erosion, dredging etc., ship traffic and other marine activities. These drivers should then be analysed to translate them into the specific stress effects they may cause.</div><h3 data-label="596676" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">5.&nbsp;Ranking stressors based on their individual effects&nbsp;</h3><div>All the drivers found in the previous step lead to a series of stressors. One way to identify them is to connect the changes in the environment with the ecosystem health of the Great Barrier Reef by monitoring programmes using bioindicators, such as variation in corals' pigmentation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>. The stressors affecting the Great Barrier Reef are degraded water quality, ocean acidification, increased sea temperature (heat stress), low salinity, high nutrients, presence of pollutants -e.g. pesticides, plastics -, increased population of crown of thorns starfish, shipping incidents -e.g. oil spills-, ballast water - e.i. invasive species-, anchoring, disease and weather events.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schoepf2013,Brodie2012,unknown}</cite> Once the stressors are identified, their individual impact is estimated in relation to the vulnerability of the coral ecosystem to establish a hierarchy, identifying the key stressors, when considered individually. In order to evaluate the impact of a stressor, we observe how much the system is displaced from its baseline. This could be carried out using impact rating methods, described in the results, such as expert elicitation with application of expert opinion quantification methods&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2007,Smith2014,Teck2010}</cite>. Modelling is also a good tool to quantify future variations.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite></div><div>        At this stage, the key stressors may be compared to observed changes and impacts to see if they can account for these. This is highly unlikely in ecosystems affected by multiple stressors, which includes most if not all ocean regions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{UnitedNations2016}</cite>, so the next step it to estimate the spatial extent of the stressor impacts and represent these impacts extents cumulatively on a map, to progress the assessment towards increasing ecological realism.&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="469036" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">6. Cumulative impact mapping</h3><div>After having identified and ranked the stressors impacting GBR, we continue by creating a cumulative impact map. This is a very useful procedure that    gives us a visualization of the problem and allows us to see the whole picture. As we mentioned in the Theory part the professor&nbsp; (B. S. Halpern et al., 2008) first intoduced this concept and he provides a good starting point for future assessment attempts on his paper&nbsp; "A Global Map of Human Impact on Marine Ecosystems". Another example of how  the cumulative effects of different stressors can be combined in a map is demonstrated on professor's&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Maynard_2015}</cite>&nbsp;research paper "Great Barrier Reef No-Take Areas Include a Rangeof Disturbance Regimes " in which four stressors (thermal stress events, damaging waves from cyclones, Crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks and freshwater inundation ) were examined. Although this method helps scientists to identify and visualize high exposure areas, more improvements should be done in order to provide more solid and representative results, as for example   it takes into acount&nbsp;only the additive synergies between the stressors and data gaps, often, affect its sufficency.   &nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="841188" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">7.&nbsp;Describing the combined effect of the stressors and taking into account their potential interactions</h3><div>In the step coming before, some interactions      between stressors     were visible due to two or more stressors were overlapping each other. Even so, to indentify all the interactions in the Great Barrier Reef, adverse outcome pathways may be used to create a conceptual framework that outlines the potential cumulative impacts. </div><div>Once the possible interactions are found, it is still not clear whether they are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. To solve this matter, simulated additive effects between all the interacting stressors are calculated. The method to assess additive effects, which are the sum of the single ones, is found in the following paper:&nbsp;<i>Synergistic impacts of global warming on the resilience of coral reefs</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite>. Then, the expectation is compared with the reality. If the results match or are similar, then the interaction is additive. On the other hand, if the response is considerably higher, means that the combined stressors act synergistic, and, if it is lower, the interaction is antagonistic. An example that shows the complexity of this assessment is the mutual effects caused by ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperature. While the interaction between these two stressors on the dissolution of carbonate in coral reefs is antagonistic&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Trnovsky2016}</cite>, what is positive to coral's health, they can also interact synergistically making corals more susceptible to bleaching.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Anthony2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="336892" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">8.                                     Conceptual framework of stressor and ecosystem  interactions <b>       </b></h3><div>This conceptual framework found in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pendleton_2016}</cite>&nbsp;describes the ecological processes that contribute to coral reef growth and maintenance vs. the biological and anthropogenic factors that can work against these processes. Illustrating in general terms some of the reef main constituent species, the ecosystem features important to people, it then highlights the reverse in balance of calcification and decalcification taking place in the Anthropocene. Although this model gives an idea of the stressors and their effect on the reef, it fails to show the cumulative interactions explained in the previous step.&nbsp;</div>
