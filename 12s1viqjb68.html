The stressors affecting the Great Barrier Reef are degraded water quality, ocean acidification, increased sea temperature, low salinity, high nutrients, presence of pollutants -e.g. pesticides-, increased population of crown of thorns starfish, shipping incidents -e.g. oil spills-, ballast water -e.i. invasive species-, anchoring, and weather events.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schoepf2013,Brodie2012,unknown}</cite> Once the stressors are identified, their impact is measured to establish a hierarchy pointing the key stressors. Even though there are many ways to evaluate the impact of an stressor, observing how much the system is displaced from its baseline is the most used. This could be carried out using impact rating methods, mentioned above. Modelling is also a good tool to quantify future variations.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite></div><div></div><div><b>6. Cumulative impact mapping</b></div><div>After having identified and ranked the stressors impacting GBR, we continue by creating a cumulative impact map. This is a very useful procedure that    gives us a visualization of the problem and allows us to see the whole picture. As we mentioned in the Theory part the professor&nbsp; (B. S. Halpern et al., 2008) first intoduced this concept and he provides a good starting point for future assessment attempts on his paper&nbsp; "A Global Map of Human Impact on Marine Ecosystems". Another example of how  the cumulative effects of different stressors can be combined in a map is demonstrated on professor's&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Maynard_2015}</cite>&nbsp;research paper "Great Barrier Reef No-Take Areas Include a Rangeof Disturbance Regimes " in which four stressors(thermal stress events, damaging waves from cyclones, Crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks and freshwater inundation ) were examined. Although this method helps scientists to identify and visualize high exposure areas, more improvements should be done in order to provide more solid and representative results, as for example   it takes into acount&nbsp;only the additive synergies between the stressors and data gaps, often, affect its sufficency.   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>7</b><b>.</b>&nbsp;<b>Describing the combined effect of the stressors and taking into account their potential interactions</b></div><div>+++++ AOP to identify the interactions</div><div>The interactions between stressors in the Great Barrier Reef were identified in the step coming before, but it is still not clear whether they are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. To solve this matter, simulated additive effects between all the interacting stressors are calculated. The method to assess additive effects, which are the sum of the single ones, is found in the following paper:&nbsp;<i>Synergistic impacts of global warming on the resilience of coral reefs</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite>. Then, the expectation is compared with the reality. If the results match or are similar, then the interaction is additive. On the other hand, if the response is considerably higher, means that the combined stressors act synergistic, and, if it is lower, the interaction is antagonistic. An example that shows the complexity of this assessment is the mutual effects caused by ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperature. While the interaction between these two stressors on the dissolution of carbonate in coral reefs is antagonistic&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Trnovsky2016}</cite>, what is positive to coral's health, they can also interact synergistically making corals more susceptible to bleaching.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Anthony2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>8. </b></div><div>This conceptual framework found in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pendleton_2016}</cite>&nbsp;describes the ecological processes that contribute to coral reef growth and maintenance vs. the biological and anthropogenic factors that can work against these processes. Illustrating in general terms some of the reef main constituents species, the ecosystem features important to people, it then highlights the reverse in balance of calcification and decalcification taking place in the Anthropocene. Although this model gives an idea of the stressors and their effect on the reef, it fails to show the cumulative interactions explained in the previous step.&nbsp;</div>
