The stressors affecting the Great Barrier Reef are degraded water quality, ocean acidification, increased sea temperature, low salinity, high nutrients, presence of pollutants -e.g. pesticides-, increased population of crown of thorns starfish, shipping incidents -e.g. oil spills-, ballast water -e.i. invasive species-, anchoring, and weather events.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schoepf2013,Brodie2012,unknown}</cite> Once the stressors are identified, their impact is measured to establish a hierarchy pointing the key stressors. Even though there are many ways to evaluate the impact of an stressor, observing how much the system is displaced from its baseline is the most used. This could be carried out using impact rating methods, mentioned above. Modelling is also a good tool to quantify future variations.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite></div><div></div><div><b>6. Cumulative impact mapping</b></div><div>After having identified and ranked the stressors impacting GBR, we continue by creating a cumulative impact map. This is a very useful procedure that    gives us a visualization of the problem and allows us to see the whole picture.

(2013)     created a map considering and combining the regional differences between a variety of multiple stressors. As we mentioned in theTheory part, this method gives us a visualization of the problem, but more improvements should be done in order to provide more solid and representative results, as for example it takes into acount&nbsp;only the additive synergies between the stressors.</div>
