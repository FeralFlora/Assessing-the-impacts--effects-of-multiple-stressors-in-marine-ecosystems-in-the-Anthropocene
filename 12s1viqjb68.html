The stressors affecting the Great Barrier Reef are degraded water quality, ocean acidification, increased sea temperature, low salinity, high nutrients, presence of pollutants -e.g. pesticides-, increased population of crown of thorns starfish, shipping incidents -e.g. oil spills-, ballast water -e.i. invasive species-, anchoring, and weather events.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Schoepf2013,Brodie2012,unknown}</cite>&nbsp;Once the stressors are identified, their impact is measured to establish a hierarchy pointing the key stressors. Even though there are many ways to evaluate the impact of an stressor, observing how much the system is displaced from its baseline is the most used. This could be carried out using impact rating methods, mentioned above. Modelling is also a good tool to quantify future variations.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{unknown}</cite></div><div></div><div><b>6. Cumulative impact mapping</b></div><div>Creating a cumulative impact map in GBR is a very useful tool for assessing the interactions between the consequences of the different stressors. Using as a base the proposed methodology of the professor&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Heath_2008}</cite>, the researcher  Johnson et al. (2013)     created a map considering and combining the regional differences between the multiple stressors. As we mentioned in theTheory part, this method gives us a visualization of the problem, but more improvements should be done in order to provide more solid and representative results, as for example it takes into acount&nbsp; only the additive synergies between the stressors.</div>
