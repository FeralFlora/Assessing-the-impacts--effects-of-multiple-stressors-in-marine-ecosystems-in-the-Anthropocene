<div><b>Guidance questions</b></div><div><b>Fundamental questions:</b></div><ul><li>Is the expected joint effect of a cumulative pressure and effect higher (or lower) than the intensity of each pressure and effect
acting singly? In this context it is critical to assess whether the various pressures and effects overlap sufficiently in time and space to result in a potential cumulative effect on the receptor(s) of interest.</li><li>Is the cumulative effect of joint pressures and effects simply quantitatively different from the response to each individual
pressure and effectâ€”or do fundamentally new response types emerge and/or are different receptors put at risk (e.g. synergistic or antagonistic interaction), i.e. deviation from the expected outcome that is used for predicting the joint effects??</li><li>What is the expected size (i.e. magnitude, extent, intensity) of the effect caused by a given combination of pressures? This
requires a decision on which interactions are to be considered, gathering the necessary input data, running the model and describing the final uncertainty in the model.</li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="718390" class="ltx_title_subsection">Case study: Exploration of hypothetical assessment of the Great Barrier Reef</h2><div>    By applying our proposed steps explained in the results,  we'll make and explore a hypothetical  assessment of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), using articles previously analyzed during our research process to give practical examples, whenever possible, on how each step can be executed and its goal achieved.   &nbsp;</div><div><b>1.
