This complex web of interactions of direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors quickly generates a complicated and unwieldy network of multiple interactions. How to manage and assess this complexity is a challenge to all forms of cumulative effects assessment. The assessment of multiple stressors and their impacts and effects is&nbsp;clearly impractical. Therefore the application of environmental risk assessment principles allows  a meaningful and achievable assessment for multiple stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite></div><div> 		Environmental risk assessment is a process of choice, based on identifying the likely consequences of different oeffects and impacts and selecting the best actions &nbsp;to minimising and managing environmental risks (Defra, 2011).&nbsp;</div><div> 				</div><h2 data-label="718390" class="ltx_title_subsection">Case study: Exploration of hypothetical assessment of the Great Barrier Reef</h2><div>    By applying our proposed steps explained in the results,  we'll make and explore a hypothetical  assessment of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), using articles previously analyzed during our research process to give practical examples, whenever possible, on how each step can be executed and its goal achieved.   &nbsp;</div><div><b>1.
