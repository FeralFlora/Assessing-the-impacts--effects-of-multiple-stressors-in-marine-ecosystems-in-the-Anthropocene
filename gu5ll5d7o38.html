<div>  	 	</div><div>So cumulative effects assessments involve assessing and evaluating the interactions between multiple stressors with multiple effects on multiple ecosystem components. This complex web of interactions of direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors quickly generates a complicated and unwieldy network of multiple interactions. How to manage and assess this complexity is a challenge to all forms of cumulative effects assessment. The assessment of multiple stressors and their impacts and effects is&nbsp;clearly impractical. We believe that the most appropriate filter is a consideration of the pathways between activities, pressures and ecosystem components, in particular the likelihood (risk) of exposure (Knights et al., 2013, 2015). Application of risk assessment principles allows for a scientifically defendable rationalisation of the parameters within the assessment towards a meaningful and achievable assessment.&nbsp;</div><div> 					We therefore recommend that CEA should be based around the principles of environmental risk assessment. Risk-based decision- making is a process of choice, based on identifying the likely consequences of different options and selecting the best course of action related to minimising and managing environmental risks (Defra, 2011). A simple four component cyclical framework for environmental risk assessment is described in Defra (2011) </div><div> 				</div><h2 data-label="718390" class="ltx_title_subsection">Case study: Exploration of hypothetical assessment of the Great Barrier Reef</h2><div>    By applying our proposed steps explained in the results,  we'll make and explore a hypothetical  assessment of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), using articles previously analyzed during our research process to give practical examples, whenever possible, on how each step can be executed and its goal achieved.   &nbsp;</div><div><b>1.
