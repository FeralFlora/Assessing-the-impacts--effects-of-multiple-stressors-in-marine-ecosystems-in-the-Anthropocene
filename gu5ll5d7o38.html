Including the complex interactions of direct and indirect effects in assessments very quickly generates a complicated and unwieldy network of multiple linkages. How to manage this complexity is a challenge to all forms of cumulative effects assessment. The assessment of all potential combinations of activities, pressures and ecosystem components is </div><div> 				</div><div> 				</div><div> 					</div><div>clearly impractical and as such a mechanism needs to be employed to filter the parameters included in the assessment. We believe that the most appropriate filter is a consideration of the pathways between activities, pressures and ecosystem components, in particular the likelihood (risk) of exposure (Knights et al., 2013, 2015). Application of risk assessment principles allows for a scientifically defendable rationalisation of the parameters within the assessment towards a meaningful and achievable assessment. </div><div> 					</div><div>We therefore recommend that CEA should be based around the principles of environmental risk assessment. Risk-based decision- making is a process of choice, based on identifying the likely consequences of different options and selecting the best course of action related to minimising and managing environmental risks (Defra, 2011). A simple four component cyclical framework for environmental risk assessment is described in Defra (2011) </div><div> 				</div><div> 			</div><div> 		</div><div> 	 </div>
