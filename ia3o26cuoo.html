<div>The sensitivity of models is improvable; some climate scenarios can be more sensitive than others to changes in stressors and their interactions. If the model is more sensitive to change, it can help with early warning signs, assisting in climate and environmental management. The Earth Model Systems and RCP scenarios used are very specific in their geographical, measurable, scalable, and variable abilities; making modelling insufficient in scalability and transferability. If a specific model has been set up for a spatial and temporal scale, then it’s computing ability has the highest certainty in that region and time frame. Also, the data retrieved or concentration level of each stressor varies within each model and this can give different results even though they are within the same scenario. Modelling is one of the best methods to use when predicting the future of stressors on the marine ecosystem and the forthcoming climate issues.&nbsp;<b>(citation needed)</b></div><h2>Cumulative Impact Mapping </h2><div>Cumulative Impact Mapping can seem relatively simple in that the three steps required are to calculate and map the intensity of  each stressor, map the location of the habitat types in the affected area and then applying a vulnerability  weight (Halpern et al. 2007, Halpern et al. 2008b, Teck et al. 2010, Kappel et  al. 201(<b>FIX CITATION</b>)), but it requires taking into account many assumptions. These  assumptions, respectively, lead to some strengths and limitations that are  presented above.   &nbsp;</div><div>The first advantage of this method is its ability to demonstrate its  results in a simple and visualized way. This fact makes these maps a useful  tool for many education programs and also it is east to communicate the extent  of the problem to the community. Furthermore, the framework   proposed by Halpern et al., (2008) can easily  be used and applied to local and regional scale assessment efforts, using a  more solid and integrated database.</div><div>One of the first assumptions that scientists make in this method in order  to combine stressors with variable distributions and different measurement  units, is to transform and normalize them. Additionally, as scientists have not  yet completely understood when, where or why non-additive responses  (synergistic and antagonistic) occur (Crain et al. 2008, Darling and Cote 2008)  they consider that cumulative stressor impacts are additive. The drawback of these  decisions is that the examined habitats will respond linearly to possible  changes. However, that such linear responses of  ecosystems to multiple stressors are the exception rather than the rule and  this could lead to insufficient results (Benjamin S. Halpern &amp; Fujita, 2013). Lastly, cumulative  impact mapping can rarely take into account historical references, even though  they are crucial to understanding how an area is affected by the various human  impacts on it.</div><h2>Impact Rating</h2><div>Impact rating is a rather simple, easily scalable method, where different criteria are used for ranking or rating the impacts and effects of the multiple stressors in the ecosystem. This is mostly happenning through an expert elicitation in form of a survey.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley_2017,Micheli_2013,Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>These methods are not always simple and cost-effective to collect, evaluate and rank, because you need a lot of data and expert opinions. Furthermore, the expert elicition has a high possibility to be biased. Therefore, also the possibilityof applying the method&nbsp; to other locations and studies, giving reliable information about the examined ecosystem, depends on the sufficienty of the data. This makes it difficult to provide early warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple stressors over time and to&nbsp;provide a future envision on possible interactions between the multile stresssors and ecosystem's degratation.</div><div>So all in all, the impact rating often rather goes together with other methods, such as modelling or indexes, to&nbsp;display the change of interest and provide sufficient results for the whole ecosystem in a scale or rating system, than being communicated as a single method.</div><h2>Indexes</h2><div> Indexes represent scientific results in a simple, numerical way and thereby give an general general overview of the assessment results. This gives the method&nbsp;of indexes the ability to display a rather complex investigation in an clear way. Due to that indicators seem to be useful as a baseline which indicate a focus and can be related to in further studies. At the same time this simple approach can also be too facile or vacuous since it only gives a number as outcome. Without looking at the evaluation how this number was constructed or an explanation which are the causes for this outcome, one might not understand the exact statement and validity of the index, especially if it is a highly complex index. Therefore the communicabilty, especially to laypeople, which represent the broader audience, is decreasing in value or remains rather trivial. Combing the index with a further method such as mapping could benefit the communicability. Indexes being a mathematical contruct of various variables are fairly sensitive and reactive to changes, due to the fact that a change of number of one variable directly effects the calculation. However the effectivesness of the index remains dependant on the individual index. The Ocean Health Index, which has already been mentioned earlier in the paper is a quite comprehensive index to illustrate ocean health. But this broad spectrum of evaluation also gives the possibilty of lack of data, hence the measureabilty as well as the sensitivity of the index declines.</div><h2 data-label="281562" class="ltx_title_subsection">                             &nbsp;</h2><div><table>   <tbody><tr>    <td>    <div><b>1</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Problem formulation and the purpose of the    assessment</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>What first needs to be done is to formulate the problem, what    includes setting the protection goals, the risk assessment objectives and    important ecological considerations.</div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div><b>2</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Define baseline</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Defining which are the reference points of interest is one of    the first steps that scientist should take.Setting clear historical baselines    is essential in examining degraded ecosystems to diminish the risk of    imprecise assumptions and provide a solid base for future comparisons. </div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div><b>3</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Conceptual model of ecosystem (focus on elements    and processes)</b></div>    <div><b>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    </b><b>identify bio-ecological receptors and    their relationships</b></div>    <div><b>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    </b><b>Relate the model to the concept of    ecosystem health</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>After finding the potential receptors, the ecosystem is    represented in a conceptual framework focusing on the receptors, their    interactions and the ecological processes.

Since non of these methods was able  to provide a complete assessment individually, their combination was chosen.  This union is done by using the strengths of every method and ruling out the  weaknesses, which are determined by the preceding section which judges the different assesments criteria. In the table found in the appendix x, the similar procedures chosen by the different methods are shown by marking them with the same colour.&nbsp; Furthermore, the 9 steps are grouped into four sections called&nbsp;<b><i>(we have to name the 4 sections beneath)</i></b> (Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{466921}</span>).&nbsp;</div>
