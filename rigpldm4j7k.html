The healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite></div><h3 data-label="126459" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><div>                                        </div><div>Evaluating  ecosystem health, we need different kinds of metrics, such as ecosystem  indicators, biomarkers or trophic level indicators.</div><div>            </div>
