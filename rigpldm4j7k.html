The healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite></div><div>Evaluating  ecosystem health, we need different kinds of metrics, such as ecosystem  indicators, biomarkers or trophic level indicators.</div><h3 data-label="292142" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">        Ecosystem Indicators</h3><div>Scientists’ interest in choosing appropriate indicators for evaluating the ecosystem health has grown over the last two decades and nowadays ecological indicators are used widely to communicate information about ecosystems and the impact human activity has on them. Indicators are usually used to track negative change or degradation of an ecosystem. They often demonstrate damage that has already occurred and provide little information about future degradation.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>For better results and precise outcomes in the evaluation process, indicators must be carefully selected, in order to represent ­­­the various aspects of an ecosystem. Any indicator should be sensitive enough to provide an early warning of change, able to detect changes over a wide geographical area and capable of providing a continuous assessment over many different  stressors. Furthermore, an indicator should be relatively independent of sample size, easy and cost-effective to measure, collect and calculate and able to understand the differences between the natural cycles or trends and the human  induced stressors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3 data-label="869012" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Biomarkers</h3><div>Thermal stress is one indicator in the present height of research and concern. As anthropogenic activity increases the temperature of the ocean, many marine communities show signs of stress as an effect of the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. Evaluating certain aspects of the ocean can help us understand, predict, and hopefully slow down the impacts imposed by human existence. But how can we start evaluation of stress? Researchers look for biomarkers which can indicate &nbsp;environmental change.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sammarco2013}</cite></div><div>Physical appearance is a possible key biomarker, a quantifiable characteristic in which can be measured and  can help identify a biological process,&nbsp; of stressor impacts on coral reefs as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Cooper2009}</cite> point out a prime example of this in the symbiotic relationship between corals and microalgae, and the joint pigmentation they produce. Within coral live photosynthetic dinoflagellate, a type of microscopic algae. The two organisms live in symbiosis; the coral providing accommodation, carbon dioxide, and nutrients while the algae supply molecular oxygen produced by photosynthesis and also fixed carbon which aids in the coral’s energy requirements.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sammarco2013,Solayan2016,corals}</cite> Brightness in corals is a direct effect of the corals having light-absorbing compounds that result in pigmentation but they are aided by the pigments found in their symbiont photosynthetic microscopic organisms.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite> Measuring this pigmentation is a potential assessment tool in assessing water quality and furthermore, the overall health of the ecosystem. Water quality is defined as a change in its chemistry, including changes in the concentration of the amount of nutrients, rates of sedimentation and levels of turbidity’. Considering that the symbiotic pair is sensitive to water quality shifting, any changes will directly affect the microorganisms in the possible changes described before. Therefore, by measuring the pigmentation of both coral and the microscopic algae, one can gain an understanding of the surrounding water quality.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>.</div><div>Another efficient tool for scientists who want to evaluate the health of an ecosystem is the use of empirical estimated indicators, which are categorized into primary producers and primary consumers.</div><h3 data-label="536979" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">                                   Single trophic level indicators</h3><div>          &nbsp;Primary producers are indicators which consist of the phytoplankton and the phytobenthic groups.

An ecosystem model can be used to compute a group of indicators describing the physical attributes, lower trophic levels (phyto- and zooplankton mainly in pelagic systems), higher trophic levels, and ecosystem principles. Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an indicator would take under different situations.

Ecosystem services, the first classification, &nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010), ecosystem functions referring to “the ecological processes that control the flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter through an environment” (Cardinale et al., 2012) and ecosystem benefits that are “the products or experiences that people create from ecosystem services and they are no longer functionally connected to the ecosystems” (Haines-Young and Potschin 2013). Identifying sufficient service, function and benefit indicators remains a challenge due to the complexity of marine ecosystems. However, once the proper indicators for each classification are chosen, and they are assessed in conjunction, they can give a more complete understanding of how an ecosystem change (Hattam et al., 2015).</div><h2 data-label="954632" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="622204" class="ltx_title_subsection">Relevant marine ecology principles and concepts
