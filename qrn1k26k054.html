This last division can be separated in&nbsp;<b>neritic province&nbsp;</b>-water over  continental shelves- and&nbsp;<b>oceanic province</b>  -water below continental shelves-. Moreover, another vertical distinction is  done creating the&nbsp;<b>intertidal zone</b>,  that lies on the shore and is defined by tidal fluctuations, the&nbsp;<b>photic zone</b>, where there is light  enough to perform the photosynthesis, and the&nbsp;<b>aphotic zone</b>, that lacks sunlight. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016)</div><h3 data-label="608611" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">  Spatial classification  of marine organisms</h3><div>    Marine organisms are classified in three  groups. Firstly, <b>benthos</b> live in the  ocean bottom and can be <b>epifauna</b> if they  are on the surface or <b>infauna</b> if  they live buried (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016). <b>Nekton </b>is formed by all the animals  that move freely of the currents and <b>Plankton</b>  comprises all the organisms that drift with water flows (Webber/Thurman, 1991). Plankton have an  important role in marine biogeochemical cycles, for that reason also affect the  chemical composition of sea water. (Mullin, 2001)</div><h3 data-label="568801" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Trophic levels and relationships</h3><div>    First of all, organisms are organized in  different <b>trophic levels</b> according  to their feeding relationships. (Trites, 2001) The energy in the  ocean is transferred by photoautotrophic organisms, or <b>primary producers</b>, placed in the first trophic level to the  herbivores, or <b>primary consumers</b>, that  form the second trophic level. They are followed by the carnivores, also called  <b>secondary and tertiary consumers</b>,  that occupy the third and last trophic level. In addition, there is a group  called <b>decomposers</b>, existing on  waste and dead remains, that breakdown all the organic matter. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016) All of them form a <b>food web</b> in which all the organisms  rely on the organic matter produced by primary producers. In the ocean, the  principal primary producers are phytoplankton, zooplankton are the primary  consumers and the rest are secondary and tertiary consumers. (Gaedke, 2009)</div><div><b>Trophic  cascade</b> is defined by (Herendeen., 2004) as the change in the  stock of one trophic level when the stock of another trophic level is changed.  They are the consequences of a higher trophic level on their following one. (Pace, 2013) Even though this  last case is the most common, infectious agents can also produce a trophic  cascade. (Julia C. Buck, William J.   Ripple, 2017)</div><div>  &nbsp;Moreover, trophic interactions are defined  as relationships between different organisms residing in the same area These  interactions are <b>symbiotic</b> if at  least one of the involved species is benefited. They can be classified in three  subgroups: <b>mutualism</b> -benefits to  both symbiont and host-, <b>parasitism</b>  -provides benefit to the symbiont to expense of the host-<b>, </b>and in <b>commensalism</b>  -the symbiont benefits from the host without causing any effect on it. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016).</div><div>    Humans can affect community composition,  extinction, and evolution of species by their activities. (Hellmann, 2013)</div><h3 data-label="273857" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> Primary  production</h3><div>  &nbsp;Primary production is defined as the synthesis  of organic material from carbon dioxide by, normally, photosynthesis. (Webber/Thurman, 1991) The total amount  produced is called&nbsp;<b>gross primary  production</b> nd the amount avaible for the consumers&nbsp;<b>net primary production</b>. One method of calculating the quantity of  net photosynthetic production is estimating the rate of change in O2  production or CO2 consumption. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016). Moreover, its  distribution in the ocean shows the nutrient stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Chavez FP1, Messié M,   Pennington JT., 2011)</div><h3 data-label="824515" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">  Carbon  cycle</h3><div>    The carbon cycle plays a very important role  on Earth and makes life possible. Carbon dioxide is the first component in food  chains and also acts as a climate regulator, providing to our planet a stable  temperature. When it forms carbonate ions, it behaves as an acidity buffer. It  also forms the skeleton of many marine organisms when carbonate is combined  with calcium. (Shields, 2015) The ocean is known to absorb 25% of the anthropogenic carbon  dioxide emissions - dissolved CO2&nbsp;concentration  increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2-, for that reason we can suggest that the carbon cycle is  controlled by the ocean. (Matthieu Roy-Barman, Catherine Jeandel, 2016)</div><div>  Firstly, carbon is absorbed by  phytoplankton and it forms organic compounds. Afterwards, these compounds are  discomposed to carbon dioxide through respiration or autolytic breakdown. (Webber/Thurman, 1991)</div><div> Furthermore, the carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere is dissolved in the ocean. It reacts with water and form carbonic  acid. This instable molecule will split into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate.  Then, the bicarbonate will react with calcium carbonate causing its  precipitation. (Webber/Thurman, 1991)</div><div>  Therefore, marine primary production and the  carbon cycle are closely related because if too much carbon dioxide is absorbed  by phytoplankton, ph will increase. The ocean will react transforming the  bicarbonate into carbonate realising hydrogen ions to stabilize it. (Webber/Thurman, 1991)</div><h3 data-label="995732" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Stressors</h3><div>    Stressor is defined as “any external  abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its normal  operating range”. (H. Segner, M. Schmitt<a>-</a>Jansen, S. Sabater, 2014)</div><div>    It is important to differentiate the  concepts: stressor, stress, and stress response. <b>Stressor</b> is an external factor; <b>stress</b> is an internal state created by a stressor, and <b>stress response</b> is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress. (Straalen, 2003)</div><div>    Additionally, stress response entails  adaptive mechanisms that cost energy from biological systems. By creating a new  stable state or returning to conditions of the original one, stress would be  removed from the system. (H. Segner, M. Schmitt-Jansen,   S. Sabater, 2014)</div><div>    Moreover, different stressors acting  together may have distinct impacts than a single one, resulting nonlinear  effects. Their impacts are determined by their strength, duration, and timing,  as well as by the proprieties of the receptor.<a> </a>(H. Segner, M.   Schmitt-Jansen, S. Sabater, 2014)</div><div>            </div><h2 data-label="112016" class="ltx_title_subsection">Interaction of multiple stressors and assessment methods</h2><div>
As the preceding sections have shown, the challenges of effectively and accurately assessing and predicting the outcomes of multiple stressors acting in parallel on marine ecosystems lie in the inherent complexity of the task - arising both from the interwoven nature of ecosystems with webbed relationships of direct and&nbsp; indirect interdependence, as well as the overlapping effects of the stressors themselves. The ecosystems affected by multiple stressors can not be assumed to be in any one stable state, when assessed long-term or even inter-annually, as the ongoing effects of human impacts and systemic alterations to the biosphere continue to develop in magnitude, multitude and spatial extent, thus forcing future assessment and management efforts to take on a more holistic, dynamic and earth-system / ecologically insightful approach to avoid non-linear effects and resultant ecological surprises, which might otherwise thwart the  efforts to stave of the ongoing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ceballos_2015}</cite> (or conservatively, impending&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rothman_2017}</cite>) Sixth Mass Extinction. As a result, given the multivariate nature and complexity of the issue, univariate impact assessments may well be rendered effectively obsolete in most future oceanic contexts, except when conducted as part of  systemic analyses.</div><div>Paradoxically, there is simultaneously a need to pay greater attention to specific characteristics of stressors, biological receptors and their physical environments and the dynamics and interactions between these, and a need to simplify these complexities in a way that allows for effective analysis in an timely manner, balancing holism and information overload. The latter is underlined by the urgency of the biodiversity and ecosystem stability crisis.</div><div>We'll now consider the conventional approaches to impact assessments and highlight some of their strengths as well as the pitfalls that have inspired the efforts to develop new approaches, both in extension of the existing methods and in novel ways. Thereafter, we'll give a rough outline of general themes in&nbsp;multiple stressor assessments, which are expanded upon in the results and discussion section of the report.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="218717" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conventional ecological risk and impact assessments</h2><div>Ecotoxicology,&nbsp;"the branch of Toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by  natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human),  vegetable and microbial, in an integral context.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Truhaut1977}</cite>, developed from toxicology's initial focus on the dose-response of individuals within test populations to chemicals into a similar measure for ecological toxicity, where a concentration of a chemical in an environment amounts to a certain degree of toxicity concluding with an ecological risk assessment. Viewed as an attempt at an integration of ecology and toxicology,&nbsp; ecotoxicology has been criticised for being too simplistic - leaning more towards toxicology than ecology and failing to account sufficiently for the categorical difference between an individual and communities, where population size and constitution are deciding factors, rather than the response mode of an individual.</div><blockquote><div>Although research in ecotoxicology has progressed substantially from simplified, single-species laboratory tests, the ecotoxicological data that provide the scientific input to risk assessments are based primarily on such simple tests.</div></blockquote><div>To extrapolate from these simplified single-species laboratory tests to complex ecosystems, two conceptual approaches are generally applied:</div><ol><li>PNECs (Predicted No Effect Concentrations)</li><li>SSDs (Species Sensitivity Distributions)</li></ol><div>PNECs are thresholds that assign the upper concentration limit until which ecological effects remaining unlikely. SSDs are applications of available critical response data such as NOEC (No-Observed-Effect Concentrations) or EC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;(sublethal response in 50% of the population)<sub>&nbsp;</sub>information, from either prospective or retrospective risk assessments, as a function of chemical concentrations to derive a frequency distribution of affected species. When SSDs are applied, they are used to inform about a concentration that will leave a large fraction (90–95%) of the affected species above the critical-effect threshold, which is interpreted as allowing the continued integrity of intact ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Calow2003}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>As noted by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Segner2014}</cite> "This approach neglects the fact that toxic chemicals in the environment do not act in isolation, but their impact on biota is modulated by the presence of other biotic and abiotic stressors." Therein lies the major pitfall of the current ecotoxilogical approaches to risk and impact assessments, and the crux of the multiple stressor challenge.</div><h2 data-label="273940" class="ltx_title_subsection">Themes in multiple stressor assessments</h2><div>The challenges of multiple stressor assessments largely arise from or relate to the vast amounts of data involved, from across several related but separate fields with varying focuses along with separate terminologies and methodologies. Thus, synthesis challenges are prominent, and a key aspect of overcoming these challenges lies in improving reproducibility, consistency and the ease of collaboration. To do so, researchers working on the Ocean Health Index project applied principles and software from data science, specifically tools that enable collaborative<i> open data science</i>, defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Hampton_2015}</cite> as: "the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers." to better their scientific computing and oversee the necessary complexity of environmental science&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2017}</cite>. Going deeper into the specifics of the methodologies recommended by Lowndes et al. (2017) is not within the scope of this project, but the developments within ecology and other environmental towards assimilation of methodologies derived from data science in general are important trends that facilitate the shift from reductionistic to holistic science. At the same time, the application of these data science methodologies might enable environmental researchers to conduct better, more reproducible (and thus trustworthy) science in less time, which is imperative since time is of the essence in matters of understanding, communicating and acting on our understanding of the ecological issues in the Anthropocene, and how they relate to societal matters. Effective public communication of these matters  has been emphasized by ecologists, witnessing the all-encompassing&nbsp;extent of human impacts, for decades,  advocating for greater interdisciplinary science, and stressing that "Ecology is a discipline with a time limit, because much of what we study, upon which society is dependent, is fast disappearing."&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bazzaz}</cite>.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h3 data-label="269602" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Stressor inventory: Mindmap
