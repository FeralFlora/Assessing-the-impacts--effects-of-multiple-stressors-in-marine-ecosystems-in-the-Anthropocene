This last division can be separated in&nbsp;<b>neritic province&nbsp;</b>-water over  continental shelves- and&nbsp;<b>oceanic province</b>  -water below continental shelves-. Moreover, another vertical distinction is  done creating the&nbsp;<b>intertidal zone</b>,  that lies on the shore and is defined by tidal fluctuations, the&nbsp;<b>photic zone</b>, where there is light  enough to perform the photosynthesis, and the&nbsp;<b>aphotic zone</b>, that lacks sunlight. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016)</div><h3 data-label="608611" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">  Spatial classification  of marine organisms</h3><div>    Marine organisms are classified in three  groups. Firstly, <b>benthos</b> live in the  ocean bottom and can be <b>epifauna</b> if they  are on the surface or <b>infauna</b> if  they live buried (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016). <b>Nekton </b>is formed by all the animals  that move freely of the currents and <b>Plankton</b>  comprises all the organisms that drift with water flows (Webber/Thurman, 1991). Plankton have an  important role in marine biogeochemical cycles, for that reason also affect the  chemical composition of sea water. (Mullin, 2001)</div><h3 data-label="568801" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Trophic levels and relationships</h3><div>    First of all, organisms are organized in  different <b>trophic levels</b> according  to their feeding relationships. (Trites, 2001) The energy in the  ocean is transferred by photoautotrophic organisms, or <b>primary producers</b>, placed in the first trophic level to the  herbivores, or <b>primary consumers</b>, that  form the second trophic level. They are followed by the carnivores, also called  <b>secondary and tertiary consumers</b>,  that occupy the third and last trophic level. In addition, there is a group  called <b>decomposers</b>, existing on  waste and dead remains, that breakdown all the organic matter. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016) All of them form a <b>food web</b> in which all the organisms  rely on the organic matter produced by primary producers. In the ocean, the  principal primary producers are phytoplankton, zooplankton are the primary  consumers and the rest are secondary and tertiary consumers. (Gaedke, 2009)</div><div><b>Trophic  cascade</b> is defined by (Herendeen., 2004) as the change in the  stock of one trophic level when the stock of another trophic level is changed.  They are the consequences of a higher trophic level on their following one. (Pace, 2013) Even though this  last case is the most common, infectious agents can also produce a trophic  cascade. (Julia C. Buck, William J.   Ripple, 2017)</div><div>  &nbsp;Moreover, trophic interactions are defined  as relationships between different organisms residing in the same area These  interactions are <b>symbiotic</b> if at  least one of the involved species is benefited. They can be classified in three  subgroups: <b>mutualism</b> -benefits to  both symbiont and host-, <b>parasitism</b>  -provides benefit to the symbiont to expense of the host-<b>, </b>and in <b>commensalism</b>  -the symbiont benefits from the host without causing any effect on it. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016).</div><div>    Humans can affect community composition,  extinction, and evolution of species by their activities. (Hellmann, 2013)</div><h3 data-label="273857" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> Primary  production</h3><div>  &nbsp;Primary production is defined as the synthesis  of organic material from carbon dioxide by, normally, photosynthesis. (Webber/Thurman, 1991) The total amount  produced is called&nbsp;<b>gross primary  production</b> nd the amount avaible for the consumers&nbsp;<b>net primary production</b>. One method of calculating the quantity of  net photosynthetic production is estimating the rate of change in O2  production or CO2 consumption. (John Morrissey, James L.   Sumich, Deanna R. Pinkard-Meier, 2016). Moreover, its  distribution in the ocean shows the nutrient stock.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Chavez FP1, Messié M,   Pennington JT., 2011)</div><h3 data-label="824515" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">  Carbon  cycle</h3><div>    The carbon cycle plays a very important role  on Earth and makes life possible. Carbon dioxide is the first component in food  chains and also acts as a climate regulator, providing to our planet a stable  temperature. When it forms carbonate ions, it behaves as an acidity buffer. It  also forms the skeleton of many marine organisms when carbonate is combined  with calcium. (Shields, 2015) The ocean is known to absorb 25% of the anthropogenic carbon  dioxide emissions - dissolved CO2&nbsp;concentration  increases at the same rate than the atmospheric CO2-, for that reason we can suggest that the carbon cycle is  controlled by the ocean. (Matthieu Roy-Barman, Catherine Jeandel, 2016)</div><div>  Firstly, carbon is absorbed by  phytoplankton and it forms organic compounds. Afterwards, these compounds are  discomposed to carbon dioxide through respiration or autolytic breakdown. (Webber/Thurman, 1991)</div><div> Furthermore, the carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere is dissolved in the ocean. It reacts with water and form carbonic  acid. This instable molecule will split into hydrogen ions and bicarbonate.  Then, the bicarbonate will react with calcium carbonate causing its  precipitation. (Webber/Thurman, 1991)</div><div>  Therefore, marine primary production and the  carbon cycle are closely related because if too much carbon dioxide is absorbed  by phytoplankton, ph will increase. The ocean will react transforming the  bicarbonate into carbonate realising hydrogen ions to stabilize it. (Webber/Thurman, 1991)</div><h3 data-label="995732" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Stressors</h3><div>    Stressor is defined as “any external  abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its normal  operating range”. (H. Segner, M. Schmitt<a>-</a>Jansen, S. Sabater, 2014)</div><div>    It is important to differentiate the  concepts: stressor, stress, and stress response. <b>Stressor</b> is an external factor; <b>stress</b> is an internal state created by a stressor, and <b>stress response</b> is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress. (Straalen, 2003)</div><div>    Additionally, stress response entails  adaptive mechanisms that cost energy from biological systems. By creating a new  stable state or returning to conditions of the original one, stress would be  removed from the system. (H. Segner, M. Schmitt-Jansen,   S. Sabater, 2014)</div><div>    Moreover, different stressors acting  together may have distinct impacts than a single one, resulting nonlinear  effects. Their impacts are determined by their strength, duration, and timing,  as well as by the proprieties of the receptor.<a> </a>(H. Segner, M.   Schmitt-Jansen, S.
