<h1 data-label="887908" class="ltx_title_section">Preface</h1><div>Although this report examines the topic of assessing the impacts of multiple stressors from a holistic and ecosystem-based perspective, which is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses, the treatment of the topic can not be considered exhaustive or  comprehensive enough to warrant conclusive assertions on the best practices. This is due to the complex nature and wide scope of the issue compared to the limited timeframe within which the project was conducted. The report does, however, provide a starting point for anyone looking for an overview of the topic with insights into important considerations, various approaches to the issue and how they compare based on critical criteria as well as peripheral topics. Based on the insights gained throughout the report, we do conclude on preliminary recommendations on approaches to cumulative impact assessments, which we find to be the most promising.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="821800" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>                                                                  The assessment of marine stressors has received much attention in recent  years due to the accelerated rise of human impacts, which are having dire consequences on the  ocean. It is argued that the scope of human activity  has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level, that our impacts on the  biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark history on a  geological timescale. In 2000, the word ‘Anthropocene’ (from the Greek word anthropos "human being"&nbsp; and -cene from -kainos, "new")  was introduced introduced in order to refer to the current time period in which human  impacts are just as important as natural processes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crutzen2000}</cite>. In this new era, the  Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of species loss  growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm1995,Ceballos_2015}</cite>.                                 &nbsp;<cite>Moreover, the rapid population  growth, an alarming 35% more since 1992&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ripple2017}</cite>, makes sustainability  transitions difficult to be realised. However, it is not impossible to achieve  positive changes if we evaluate and address the problem</cite><cite>.&nbsp;</cite><cite>This  is the case, for example, of the ozone-depleting substances, which have  decreased since the nineties due to the application of sustainable changes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ripple2017}</cite>. For that reason, a comprehensive assessment plays a critical role in responding to threats on the biosphere.&nbsp;</cite>       &nbsp;</div><div>    In the current climate, the ocean is drastically suffering the consequences of human activities. Varied stressors  affecting marine ecosystems, such as ocean warming, acidification, pollution,  overfishing, etc., are converting them to hostile places with life and diversity  reduction&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bernal2016}</cite>. Additionally, the ocean is a source of resources in terms of alimentation  and medicine, which the society cannot do without it. For that reason, there is  a need to preserve and protect its nature;  it is necessary to have a broad knowledge  about the present situation and how these changes can affect the humanity.</div><div>                                      The impacts of  stressors in marine ecosystems have been studied&nbsp;a lot<i> </i>during recent years, but only a few studies have focused on  the assessment of multiple stressors, considering also potential stressor  interactions and their cumulative effects. There is extensive literature on the  impacts and effects of single marine stressors, but there is a lack of awareness  concerning how they interact, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate the  present and future situation of the ocean. When different stressors act  together, their consequences are cumulative effects that present non-linear  results and ecological surprises. This leads to the challenging goal of making an  interdisciplinary and holistic approach.</div><div>                 The present paper presents different sets of criteria for multiple stressor assessment in marine ecosystems found by literature review,  describing and evaluating them. Afterwards, several steps are proposed taking into account processes  from various methods. Once this is done, it is implemented in the case study, which is the Great Barrier Reef, showing its applicability.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="799131" class="ltx_title_subsection">                          Problem formulation and Research  Question</h2><div>        Human activities  have had a significant impact on the Earth’s ecosystems. So it is now urgent to understand  that the ocean has undergone large physical and biogeochemical modifications in  response to human induced stressors. These stressors encompass ocean surface  warming, changes in ocean salinity, modifications of density structure and  stratification, an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon  concentrations, as well as decreasing seawater pH in response to ocean uptake of  anthropogenic carbon.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite></div><div>    Current approaches  to assessing the risk of anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems are  developed for single stressors. The cumulative impact of several stressors,  however, may differ from the impact of a single stressor and can result in  nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. The complexity of marine systems,  their inherent high variability, and the influence of multiple environmental  factors or stressors suggests that no single measure is adequate for assessing  the effects of multiple stressors on biota.&nbsp;</div><div>    Given this  background, the objectives of this study are to develop and provide a  literature review for assessing the effects of multiple stressors on marine  systems and assist in understanding the cumulative impact of several stressors. In  the Anthropocene, where many stressors are interacting with each other and  everything is connected in a complex web of effects, the methods we apply for  impact assessments must necessarily reflect this reality, in the present and especially  in the times ahead if we are to understand the ongoing changes and where  they will lead us.&nbsp;</div><div>    Therefore, we  collected scientific articles, journals and books for the different  categories of our research topic: the Anthropocene, ongoing changes and future  development, ecosystem health, multiple stressor assessment methods and coral  reefs. To make sure, that everyone gets the same knowledge, we divided the  articles of each topic between the group members and took notes while reading.  Through the writing progress, the topics were switched around, to reinforce each  other knowledge within the scope of our project. In between, the different sections  and especially the results of our project were discussed in several group  meetings.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>    So in the end we were able to answer our  research question: </div><div>    <b>How do we assess the effects of multiple stressors impacting the  marine ecosystem in the Anthropocene?</b></div><div>    This question is  asking for assessment methods, metrics and/or scaling for the health status of  a marine ecosystem affected by multiple stressors. Hereby, we focus on  human-induced stressors, due to the fact that these stressors now-a-days are  the biggest disturbances which challenge marine ecosystems. We want to tackle  and solve this question by finding out firstly what actually defines a healthy  ecosystem and how is ecosystem degradation generally defined. Furthermore, we  need to know what the main stressors affecting the marine ecosystem are, as well as the impact that these harmful consequences can impose but especially how they can interact and intersect.&nbsp;</div><div>    By asking these questions,  we will be able to get a more complex overview of which metrics we have to  include in our assessment of ecosystem health and multiple stressors later on.  With this foundation, we can move on to ask which methods are used or proposed  to evaluate the impacts of multiple stressors in the marine environment.  Moreover, we want to discuss how these methods compare and if these methods can  be generalized to find an overall assessment method. These questions are  elaborating the main particular question for assessment methods and questioning  their effectivity and especially their integrity and perspicuity. Moving on  from that, the question that comes up is, at which levels  the found methods can&nbsp;be applied.</div><div>   Thus, fitting to the  semester binding of our project work, “The application of natural science in  technology and society”, we will try to understand how biology and ecology can  be applied to understand how multiple stressors derived from anthropogenic and  natural causes (agitated by human activities) cumulatively affect marine environments  and, consequently, our society. We will work with multiple stressors which  affect marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene. This means that all the stressors  we are looking at somehow are human induced. Most of the stressors are related  to climate change and are caused directly by human activities. So we  can see that the stressors are constructed by us  ourselves – the society and thus our technologies. However, these stressors do  not only affect the marine ecosystem itself but the impacts are falling back on  us as well. In this way, multiple stressors affecting the marine ecosystem in  the Anthropocene becomes a concern that our society is responsible for and we must tackle the challenge that lays before us.&nbsp;</div><div>    </div><h1 data-label="543346" class="ltx_title_section">Methodology</h1><div>                                                                        An abundance of literature reviews and assessments were found as  researching types in our search for methods of assessing multiple stressors in marine ecosystems.&nbsp;At first, we provide a solid background about what is the anthropocene, then we explained how and why is important to define a healthy ecosystem and, afterwards, we  display the interactions between multiple stressors, creating a mind-map. Next,&nbsp;we present the different assessment&nbsp; methods we found, describing their function, the way they treat the data and declaring  their pros and cons, providing a  background of the current assessment frameworks.  The next step is to propose the criteria that a method should meet, discussing  and formulating this criteria based on the research paper “Marine ecosystem services: Linking  indicators to their classification”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam_2015}</cite>. Additionally, we  created a ranking table for the assessment methods, judging them by these  criteria. More specifically, we consider a method as "sufficient" or "insufficient", whether or not, respectively, there is scientific evidence that it satisfies a criterion's properties, "improving" if scientific effort is currently undergoing in the direction of a criterion's fulfilment and "not included" in case we didn't find enough information about a specific criterion. Finally, after having discussed the proposed steps from four different scientific papers (   papers (    papers (    "A Phased Approach for Assessing Combined Effects from Multiple Stressors"&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Menzie2007}</cite>,<i>"Assessing the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota: The receptor's side matters"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></i><b><i>, "</i></b><i>New approaches to the ecological risk assessment of multiple stressors"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></i><b>&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>"</b><i>The challenges and opportunities in cumulative effects assessment"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley2017}</cite></i>), searching for overlappings and new approaches, we propose a methodology for assessing the impacts of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems and focus on Great Barrier Reef, as a case study, to apply these steps.</div><h3 data-label="896089" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">  &nbsp;Criteria for judging multiple stressor methods:</h3><ul><li><b>Measurability</b> describes the ability of a  method to use indicators which are simple and cost-effective to measure, evaluate and rank.</li><li><b>Sensitivity</b> refers to the ability of a method to provide early  warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple  stressors over time.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Scalability&nbsp;</b>introduces the importance of a method to be applied to a different  scale and still retain its  ability to display the change of interest and provide sufficient results for  the whole ecosystem.</li><li><b>Transferability</b> is the scope that a method  should be useful and easily applied to other  locations and  studies,  giving reliable  information about the examined ecosystem.</li><li><b>Predictability&nbsp;</b>describes whether or not a method can provide a future vision of possible interactions between the multiple stressors and ecosystem degradation.</li><li><b>Communicability&nbsp;</b>describes  whether or not the results of an assessment method can be easily communicated  to a wide audience.

In some cases, dynamic processes such as oceanographic currents or immigration are fundamentally important and affect  the overall results, as it may      change how a stressor is distributed or how  its impacts spread among different locations&nbsp;<i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern_2009}</cite></i>. Regarding the shifting baseline syndrome, it is not yet clear what baselines should use the different methods as&nbsp;a starting point.

</h2><div>                              “Over the past 50 years,  humans have changed the world’s ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in  any other comparable period in human history”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>. But how does that apply to marine ecosystems? Around 70% of the earth surface  is covered by water, and the ocean represents roughly 99% of Earth's habitats, hence  marine ecosystems play a major role concerning the health  status of Earth's biosphere.&nbsp;</div><div>    The word "Anthropocene" was  first used by the researcher Paul J. Crutzen in 2002 as assigning this term   to                                     our current, mainly human influenced period  following the Holocene. Different authors already  used similar words before, such as Antonia Stoppani in 1873 speaking about                                      new drivers of change on Earth comparable to  natural influences and V. I. Vernadsky describing the growing impact of humans as  an evolutionary process on earth.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crutzen_2002}</cite>     &nbsp;       &nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;</div><div>It is said, that the Anthropocene began with the  industrialization and James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. Humans started to expand their use of fossil fuels and their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007,Crutzen_2002}</cite>. It is suggested, that the current human impact last for long periods&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>.</div><div>    The researchers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Steffen_2007}</cite>&nbsp;argue that the Anthropocene proceeded in three  different stages. Starting with Pre-Anthropocene events, including the first  major use of fossil fuels, leading to the first stage of the Anthropocene: The  Industrial Era. This stage, mainly described by the industrialization, started  around 1800 and ended around 1945 with the second World War. During this era, humans' energy sources were massively altered by the expansion of the use of oil,  gas and coal in industry. During the period of time from 1800 until 2000,  human energy use grew about 40-fold and global economy increased about  50-fold. Related to this, human population registered enormous growth in  numbers. Looking at the impact of the Industrial era on the biosphere by  comparing the                                     CO<sub>2</sub>         concentration in the atmosphere, the preindustrial era had an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration about 270-275 ppmv and rose above  300 ppmv until 1950. By the end of the second stage of the Anthropocene, the  Great acceleration -around 2015-, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration had increased above 380 ppmv and is currently about 407 ppmv. This extreme rise in numbers is only a small fragment  of the ecological, biogeochemical and climatic change that happened during the industrial era and the Great  acceleration, but gives a good insight in the scope of the interference with natural cycles, like the carbon cycle.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    During the second stage of  the Anthropocene, the global human population has grown to over 6 billion, the global  economy experienced a great extension, motorization proceeded and urban areas  expanded drastically, leading to widespread habitat loss; this is only mentioning a few aspects of this era characterized  by expansion, innovation and discovery.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>                                           Humans have shaped and affected the marine  ecosystem and thereby marine life, rising more and more with human development. For example, about 8% of  the primary production of the oceans is used by humans, while that fraction  grows to more than 25% in certain areas and for the temperate continental shelf systems to  more than one third. Furthermore, by 1995, one fifth of known marine fisheries  were overexploited or already exhausted and 44% were at a critical threshold&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite>. This shows the great interference of humankind with the marine ecosystem,  especially marine life.</div><div>    Since 2015, we  have entered the third stage of the Anthropocene, named 'Stewards of the Earth  System'.  Given by the name of this era, now-a-days humans are seen as a major geological  force,&nbsp;shaping the future of the system of Earth. This stage is described by growing  awareness, due to more research, global information-flow, more stable and democratic  governments, integration into policies concerns, and social and cultural  concerns.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Our current  extraction-consumption based economic&nbsp;model has led to rapid expansion of human  habitation and resource extraction causing detrimental effects on the extent  and integrity of the ecosystems and habitats that enable rich biodiversity and  vital ecosystem services. Furthermore, the resources we extract are often  returned to the environment in such a composition or context that they become  pollutants, which no longer cycle through the systems in an equilibrium or a  beneficial way. Going forward, human activity is likely to cause widespread  mass-extinctions and biodiversity loss with adverse consequences for future  habitability on earth, should we stay on a business as usual course without  altering our ways. Referring to the article “The future of biodiversity”,  currently the Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of  species loss growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm_1995,Ceballos2015}</cite> The atmospheric concentrations of several important greenhouse gases have  increased substantially. As a result the Earth is warming rapidly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014}</cite> and more nitrogen is now  converted from the atmosphere into reactive forms by fertilizer production and  fossil fuel combustion compared to all of the natural processes in terrestrial  ecosystems put together.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Galloway_2002}</cite></div><div>Many of the systemic global human-induced  stress on marine ecosystems can be ascribed to climate change.

For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source of food and  a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we do. But in  the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the ocean has  limits and that in many important parts of our seas the sustainability  thresholds have been breached&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite>.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{riebesell2017}</cite>&nbsp;describes this impact by defining  the Anthropocene in “Ocean change: a mix of interacting stressors” as an age in  which humans impact the environment and Earths’ ecosystems to the same amount  or even more than natural influences. Furthermore, he emphasizes marine  ecosystems in this era while describing ocean change as an ongoing process in  the whole history of earth and that the present ocean change be unique in the  modern time. It be the fastest change and perhaps the biggest influence, that a  single species ever had and that species be modern humans – us.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{riebesell2017}</cite></div><div>                                            For this  reason there is a need to understand the ongoing processes of ocean change and  the changes in marine ecosystems and their health.</div><div><b>Defining Marine Ecosystem Health</b> </div><h3>The concept and challenge of marine ecosystem health</h3><div>As described previously, the marine ecosystem is an important biological system that provides a service to humanity as a whole.   There is an urgency for environmental management of this ecosystem due to  the rapidness of its declining state, and therefore examining its state of health is of concern.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>Promising to prevent and assess this declining state, is to understand the basic concept of marine ecosystem health. Underlying of Ecosystem health is the idea, that ecosystems have an optimal, healthy and natural state, which is urged to protect and retain. But what means "healthy" in this context and what kind of properties has a marine ecosystem to display to be classified as healthy? Marine ecosystem health is difficult to define, because as an open system, it is in a constant flux and exchange with its surrounding. Furthermore there are different perceptions of the elements which belong to a marine ecosystem. Generally it can be said, that a marine ecosystem consists of the abiotic environment and the biotic community, but it's argued if this includes humans as a property of this construct as well. Based on this, marine ecosystem health is not seen as a single feature, but as the sum of contributions of the biotic community, meaning individuals and populations and the abiotic processes within the system.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>A healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite> &nbsp;</div><div>As  it is beneficial to understand where an ecosystem was prior to  stressors, there are common symptoms of signal ecosystem  degradation. They have been identified from reoccurring stressor impacts  and described with the ecosystem distress syndrome concept.</div><div>Degradative symptoms characterize many ecosystems that are experiencing multiple stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Rapport_1992}</cite>  claims that aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome can include some or  most of the symptoms listed: alteration in biotic community structure to  favor smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by  'r' selected species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened  food-chain length, increased disease prevalence, and reduced population  stability.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>To assess the dilemmas, which are faced when understanding&nbsp;ecosystem health, the application of a human health metaphor is suggested. There are three fundamental issues which are proposed: recognizing the absence of objective criteria for assessing health indicators, recognizing when changes are actual or a false alarm, and the quest to find classifying indicators with attributes of being holistic, early warning or diagnostic.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><div>Above those issues, we  face a two-fold challenge of increasing knowledge on ecosystem behavior and multiple stressors knowledge and working on the development of an identification system of indicators while we deal with the anthropogenic stressors which impact the integrity of biological ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><h3>       Ecosystem Indicators</h3><div>Scientists’  interest in choosing appropriate indicators for evaluating the  ecosystem health has grown over the last two decades and nowadays  ecological indicators are used widely to communicate information about  ecosystems and the impact human activity has on them. Indicators are  usually used to track negative change or degradation of an ecosystem.  They often demonstrate damage that has already occurred and provide  little information about future degradation&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite>.</div><div>For  better results and precise outcomes in the evaluation process,  indicators must be carefully selected, in order to represent ­­­the  various aspects of an ecosystem. Any indicator should be sensitive  enough to provide an early warning of change,&nbsp;be able to detect changes  over a wide geographical area and capable of providing a continuous  assessment over many different  stressors. Furthermore, an indicator  should be relatively independent of sample size, easy and cost-effective  to measure, collect and calculate and able to understand the  differences between the natural cycles or trends and the human  induced stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3>Biomarkers</h3><div>                                      Thermal stress is one indicator in the present height of  research and concern. As anthropogenic activity increases the temperature of  the ocean, many marine communities show signs of stress as an effect of the  ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. Evaluating certain aspects of the ocean warming can  help us understand, predict, and hopefully slow down the impacts imposed by  human existence. Furthermore, physical appearance is a possible key biomarker, a quantifiable  characteristic which can be measured and can help identify a biological  process. A prime example of this  is the symbiotic relationship between corals and micro-algae, and the joint  pigmentation they produce&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>. More specifically, brightness in corals is a direct effect of the corals  having light-absorbing compounds that result in pigmentation. Measuring this pigmentation is a potential  assessment tool in assessing water quality and furthermore, the overall health  of the coral ecosystem. Finally, water quality is defined as a change in its chemistry,  including changes in the concentration of the amount of nutrients, rates of  sedimentation and levels of turbidity. Considering that the symbiotic pair is sensitive  to water quality shifting, any changes will directly affect the microorganisms  in the possible changes described before.&nbsp;</div><div>  Another efficient tool for scientists who want  to evaluate the health of an&nbsp; ecosystem  is the use of trophic levels indicators. Distinction has been made between  single and multiple trophic levels indicators, as described in the following  paragraphs.&nbsp;       &nbsp;</div><h3>                                  Single trophic level indicators</h3><div>           Primary producers are indicators which consist of the  phytoplankton and the phytobenthic groups. Tracking phytoplanktons’ fast  growth rates and response to low levels pollutants, scientists can  identify sensitive and early signs­­ of ecological changes and  environmental disturbance in marine surface waters&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{PAERL_2003}</cite>. Additionally, phytobenthic  groups are sensitive indicators of changes in marine environments as  they  live long and  undergo  chronic disturbances                                 which  affect their&nbsp;diversity, total abundance  and total biomass        &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,VanHoey2010}</cite>.</div><div>Primary  consumer indicators include the zooplankton and zoobenthic groups. In  2005, the professor Weijerman mentioned that the abundance of  zooplankton species can be used to document sudden ecosystem shifts in  different regions of the world and also help identify the effects of  global warming and its consequences on regional hydrodynamics&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Beaugrand2009}</cite>. As  regard to zoobenthic groups, their structural characteristics can be  useful to monitor the impacts of environmental stress in coastal systems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007}</cite>&nbsp;and they can also be used in detecting early environmental disturbances, especially in estuarine habitats&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007,Elliott2007}</cite>.</div><h3>Two or more trophic level indicators</h3><div>The  restriction of using these empirical estimated indicators, however, is  that they can demonstrate the state of an ecosystem examining only a  single trophic level. The need for assessing the ecosystem health in two  or more trophic levels led scientists to introduce different  approaches. </div><div>The use of stable isotope profiles as  environmental and trophic indicators is a supporting tool to study  feeding habits, nutrient tracking, species migrations and habitat use of  species and communities in the ecosystem&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Thompson}</cite>. In addition, modelling techniques have been introduced to study ecosystem responses to different stressors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Christensen2007}</cite>.&nbsp;An  ecosystem model can be used to compute a group of indicators describing  the physical attributes, lower trophic levels (phyto- and zooplankton  mainly in pelagic systems), higher trophic levels, and ecosystem  principles. Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling  techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the  ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an  indicator would take under different situations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite>.</div><div>                                        This change  leads us to the  different impacts causing the ecosystem change and their short and long  term considerations.</div><h3 data-label="455145" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Short term and long term considerations</h3><div>Due  to the fact, that the main research goal of this project is to contribute to  greater understanding of how to assess the impacts and effects of multiple  stressors in marine ecosystems in our current time of climate and environmental  change, we should try to simplify this complex web of different stressors  interacting with each other to get a general overview of the ongoing changes.  Thus, it is beneficial to review the concept of assessing ecosystem health to  understand the assessing of multiple stressors and their interactions.</div><div>As already shown before, the  “aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome” lists different symptoms characterizing  ecosystem health&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite>. All these  symptoms are examples for&nbsp;abiotic and biotic factors in ecosystems for which one can apply the maxim for complex metabolic or ecosystem processes, called  “Blackman’s principle”. According to this principle, the rate of the process is  limited by the pace of the slowest abiotic or biotic factor, when the process  is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors. Blackman used this principle specifically to describe the metabolic process of photosynthesis.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{BLACKMAN_1905}</cite>&nbsp;To  illustrate this, imagine a large wine cask, where one of the planks is shorter  than the others. This means it is not possible to fill more wine in the cask  than the high of the shortest plank. The shortest plank in this case functions  as a metaphor for the limiting abiotic or biotic factor.&nbsp;</div><div>    Transferring  this concept to an ecosystem with multiple interacting stressors, this could  help to find a method for assessing multiple stressors and improve their  impacts and effects on marine ecosystems. Considering different ways of  classifying, grouping, quantifying and understanding stressors and the systems  they impact at various organizational levels, according to the Blackman’s  principle, there (probably) is a limiting factor. </div><div>    In a  study of the Australian Institute of Marine Science it is mentioned, that in a  short time perspective, it could help to improve local stressors with an acute  impact in marine ecosystems, but in long term there is most likely a  stabilization of the ocean temperature needed to prevent the coral losses in  marine ecosystems, because, in this case, temperature as a stressor causes a  lot of other negative impacts and effects on the marine ecosystems. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{De_ath_2012}</cite>&nbsp;Thus, temperature would be the limiting factor or stressor. This means, even if  one, theoretically, improves all other stressors, in a long term perspective not  all changes in the ecosystem health could be prevented, due temperature rise  would still have a quite big impact on the condition of the ecosystem. </div><div>    The  Blackman’s principle thus gives us a general idea on how to improve ecosystem  health and minimize the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in a long  term perspective by finding the limiting stressor, which is most likely the  rise of CO<sub>2</sub> and thus temperature.</div><div>    So  all in all, the concept of ecosystem health could be useful to be able to  assess and predict how marine organisms and their ecosystems will adapt and  respond to different stressors acting in unison, and also which the most significant  or substantial ones are, so we can suggest a systematic framework of these  colossal changes to integrate the effects less universal stressors into.</div><h1 data-label="147465" class="ltx_title_section">                     &nbsp;</h1><h2 data-label="444527" class="ltx_title_subsection">Key stressors and potential interactions&nbsp;</h2><div>                              The complexity of the assessment of  multiple stressors lies in the complexity of the interactions themselves.<i>&nbsp;</i>Even though great advances in this  field have been done, most cumulative effects of mutual influences between  stressors remains uncertain.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>First of all, stressors are defined as “any  external abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its  normal operating range” <a href="#Segner2014"><i>(Segner et al., 2014)</i></a> It is important to differentiate the concepts: stressor, stress, and stress  response.&nbsp;While a stressor is an external factor,&nbsp;stress is an  internal state created by a stressor, and&nbsp;stress response is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress.&nbsp;<a href="#StraalenN__dot__M__dot__2003"><i>(Straalen N.M., 2003)</i></a></div>
