</h2><div>                                     &nbsp;&nbsp;The Anthropocene,  our current time in earth history, means the era after the Holocene. There are  different approaches for defining this ongoing time.&nbsp;</div><div>    It’s argued that the scope of human  activity has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level that our  impacts on the biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark  history on a geological timescale. In this new epoch, the Anthropocene, humans  have arguably become the main driver of change in the environment.&nbsp;</div><div>    The word ‘Anthropocene’ was  first used by the researcher Paul J. Crutzen in 2002 as assigning “the term  ‘Anthropocene’ to the present, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch,  supplementing the Holocene - the warm period of the past 10-12 millennia.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Crutzen_2002}</cite> Different authors already  used similar words before, such as Antonia Stoppani in 1873 speaking about a  “new telluric force which in power and universality may be compared to the  greater forces of earth" (quoted from&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{crutzen2002}</cite>) and V. I. Vernadsky describing the growing impact  of humans through: “The direction in which the processes of evolution must  proceed, namely towards increasing consciousness and thought, and forms having  greater and greater influence on their surroundings.” (quoted from <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Crutzen_2002}</cite>)</div><div>&nbsp;The Anthropocene began with the  industrialisation and James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. The  humans started to expand their use of fossil oils and their CO2 emissions. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007,Crutzen_2002}</cite>&nbsp;It is suggested, that the current human impact last for long periods.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    The researchers Steffen,  Crutzen and McNeill are stating that the Anthropocene proceeded in three  different stages. Starting with Pre-Anthropocene events, including the first  major use of fossil fuels, leading to the first stage of the Anthropocene: The  Industrial Era. This stage, mainly described by the industrialization, started  around 1800 and ended around 1945 with the second World War. During this era  humans energy source was massively altered by the expansion of the use of oil,  gas and coil in industry. During the period of time from 1800 until 2000,  humans energy used grew about 40-fold and global economy increased about  50-fold. Related to this, human population registered enormous growth in  numbers. Looking at the impact of the Industrial era on the biosphere by  comparing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the preindustrial era  accounted an atmospheric CO2 concentration about 270-275 ppmv and rose above  300 ppmv until 1950. By the end of the second stage of the Anthropocene, the  Great acceleration, around 2015, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has  increased above 380 ppmv. This extreme rise in numbers is only a small fragment  of the ecological change that happened during the industrial era and the Great  acceleration, but gives a good insight in the scope of the interference.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    During the second stage of  the Anthropocene, humans population has grown over 6 billion, the global  economy experienced a great extension, motorisation proceeded and urban areas  expanded drastically. This stating only a few aspects of this era characterized  by expansion, innovation and discovery. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    “Over the past 50 years,  humans have changed the world’s ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in  any other comparable period in human history.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>  But how does that apply on marine ecosystems? 71 percent of the earth surface  is covered by water, and the ocean represents 99 percent of earths habitats&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{httpssciencenasagovearth-scienceoceanographyliving-ocean}</cite>, this leads to the  assumption, that marine ecosystem play a major role, concerning the health  status of earths ecosystem. Humans have shaped and effected the marine  ecosystem, rising more and more with human development. For example ''humans  use about 8% of the primary production of the oceans, that fraction grows to  more than 25% for&nbsp; areas and to 35% for  temperate continental shelf systems" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite>. Furthermore ''22% of recognised marine fisheries were overexploited or already  depleted by 1995, and 44% more were at their limit of exploitation''<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite>.  This shows the great interference of humankind on the marine ecosystem,  especially marine life.&nbsp;</div><div>    Since 2015, we  have entered the third stage of the Anthropocene, named “Stewards of the Earth  System” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>.  Given by the name of this era, now-a-days humans are seen as “major geological  force” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>,  shaping the future of the earth system.This stage is described by “growing  awareness” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>,  due to more research, global information-flow, more stable and democratic  governments, integration into policies concerns and social and cultural  concerns. </div><div>    Our current  extraction-consumption based economic&nbsp; model has led to rapid expansion of human  habitation and resource extraction causing detrimental effects on the extent  and integrity of the ecosystems and habitats that enable rich biodiversity and  vital ecosystem services. Furthermore, the resources we extract are often  returned to the environment in such a composition or context that they become  pollutants, which no longer cycle through the systems in an equilibrium or a  beneficial way. Going forward, human activity is likely to cause widespread  mass-extinctions and biodiversity loss with adverse consequences for future  habitability on earth, should we stay on a business as usual course without  altering our ways. Referring to the article “The future of biodiversity”,  currently the Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of  species loss growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm_1995}</cite>,  while the atmospheric concentrations of several important greenhouse gases have  increased substantially. As a result the Earth is warming rapidly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014}</cite> and more nitrogen is now  converted from the atmosphere into reactive forms by fertilizer production and  fossil fuel combustion compared to all of the natural processes in terrestrial  ecosystems put together.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Galloway_2002}</cite></div><div>    Most of the human-induced  stress on marine ecosystems can be ascribed to climate change. Climate change  being one of the major and most discussed catchphrases in our time, shows that  “(..) the recognition that human activities are indeed affecting the structure  and functioning of the Earth System (..) is filtering through to  decision-making at many levels”.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Human activities have had a  significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems; especially in marine ecosystems.  For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source of food and  a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we do. But in  the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the ocean has  limits and that in many important parts of our seas the sustainability  thresholds have been breached.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite>U Ulf Riebesell describes this  impact by defining the Anthropocene in “Ocean change: a mix of interacting  stressors” as “the age in which the human activity on the environment is  comparable to or even greater than natural influences.” Furthermore, he  emphasizes marine ecosystems in this era while describing ocean change as an  ongoing process in the whole history of earth and that the present ocean change  be unique in the modern time. It be the fastest change and perhaps the biggest  influence, that a single species ever had and that species be modern humans –  us. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{riebesell}</cite></div><div>     &nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="298655" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Defining The Health of Marine Ecosystems</b></h2><h3 data-label="340009" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The Importance of Understanding Ecosystems</h3><div> The marine ecosystem is an important biological system that provides services to humanity as a whole and therefore we  are a&nbsp;beneficiary to the ocean for what it provides; but research today is stressing the urgency for environmental management of this ecosystem due to  the rapidness of its declining state&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>. How do we protect the biological systems that has evolved &nbsp;into the foundation of sustaining life on Earth?</div><div>Described by Tett et al., (2013), trophic networks link species throughout the marine ecosystem; consequent cascades from one disturbance can cause direct and indirect impacts that impair the services that ecosystems provide. If protection of ecosystem services and the sustainability as a whole is to be successful, we must understand the links between species, comprehend the ecosystem in its entirety, and identify the most efficient and reliable assessment methods&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite>.</div><h3 data-label="667365" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Facing the Challenges&nbsp;</h3><div>Suggested by &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Rapport1992}</cite> is an application of a human health metaphor which can help us to  assess the dilemmas in which we will face when understanding ecosystem health. There are three fundamental issues which is proposed: recognising the absence of objective criteria for assessing health indicators, recognising when changes are actual or a false alarm, and the quest to find classifying indicators with attributes of being holistic, early warming or diagnostic. A two-fold challenge we face: boost ecosystem behaviour and multiple stressor knowledge and work on the development of an identification system of indicators while dealing with the anthropogenic stressors which impact the integrity of biological ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport1992}</cite>.</div><h3 data-label="233760" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Characteristics of a degradative ecosystem&nbsp;</h3><div>As it is beneficial to understand where an ecosystem was prior to stressors, there are common symptoms in which signal ecosystem degradation; they have been identified from reoccurring stressor impacts and described with the ecosystem distress syndrome concept.</div><div>Degradative symptoms characterize many ecosystems that are experiencing multiple stressors. Rapport (1992) claims that aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome can include some or most of the symptoms listed: alteration in biotic community structure to favour smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by 'r' selected species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened food-chain length, increased disease prevalence, and reduced population stability .</div><h3 data-label="506091" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Proposing the state of a healthy ecosystem</h3><div>Having mentioned the importance of evaluating the ecosystem health, it is proper to give a definition of what a healthy ecosystem is. The professors Costanza and Mageau (1999) suggest that healthy is characterizing an ecosystem that is capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem’s components) over time, in the presence of a stress(resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state. (Costanza &amp; Mageau, 1999). These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse (Scheffer et al., 2015).&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="126459" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Ecosystem Indicators</h3><div>Scientists’ interest in choosing appropriate indicators for evaluating the ecosystem health has grown over the last two decades and nowadays ecological indicators are used widely to communicate information about ecosystems and the impact human activity has on them. Indicators are usually used to track negative change or degradation of an ecosystem. They often demonstrate damage that has already occurred and provide little information about future degradation (Hattam et al., 2015).&nbsp;</div><div>For better results and precise outcomes in the evaluation process, indicators must be carefully selected, in order to represent ­­­the various aspects of an ecosystem. According to Rombouts et al. (2013) any indicator should be “sufficiently sensitive to provide an early warning of change, distributed over a broad geographical area, capable of providing a continuous assessment over a wide range of stress, relatively independent of sample size, easy and cost-effective to measure, collect and calculate, able to differentiate natural cycles or trends from those induced by anthropogenic stress, and relevant to ecologically significant phenomena”. (Rombouts et al., 2013)</div><h3 data-label="869012" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Biomarkers</h3><div>Thermal stress is one indicator in the present height of research and concern. As anthropogenic activity increases the temperature of the ocean, many marine communities show signs of stress as an effect of the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. Evaluating certain aspects of the ocean can help us understand, predict, and hopefully slow down the impacts imposed by human existence. But how can we start evaluation of stress? Researchers look for biomarkers which can indicate &nbsp;environmental change (Sammarco and Strychar, 2013).&nbsp;</div><div>Physical appearance is a possible key biomarker, a quantifiable characteristic in which can be measured and  can help identify a biological process,&nbsp; of stressor impacts on coral reefs as Cooper and Fabricius (2012) point out a prime example of this in the symbiotic relationship between corals and microalgae, and the joint pigmentation they produce. Within coral live photosynthetic dinoflagellate, a type of microscopic algae. The two organisms live in symbiosis; the coral providing accommodation, carbon dioxide, and nutrients while the algae supply molecular oxygen produced by photosynthesis and also fixed carbon which aids in the coral’s energy requirements (NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Corals, no date; Sammarco and Strychar, 2013; Solayan, 2016). Brightness in corals is a direct effect of the corals having light-absorbing compounds that result in pigmentation but they are aided by the pigments found in their symbiont photosynthetic microscopic organisms (Cooper, Gilmour and Fabricius, 2009). Measuring this pigmentation is a potential assessment tool in assessing water quality and furthermore, the overall health of the ecosystem. Cooper and Fabricius (2012) define water quality as ‘‘any change in the chemistry of the seawater, including changes in the concentration of dissolved and/or particulate nutrients, rates of sedimentation and levels of turbidity’’. Considering that the symbiotic pair is sensitive to water quality shifting (Cooper, Gilmour and Fabricius, 2009), any changes will directly affect the microorganisms in the possible changes described before. Therefore, by measuring the pigmentation of both coral and the microscopic algae, one can gain an understanding of the surrounding water quality.</div><div>Solayan (2016) explains that a direct result of loss of pigmentation, mainly due to temperature rise, is bleaching of corals. Coral bleaching happens when either &nbsp;the algal symbiont is lost or there is a diminished amount of pigment from the photosynthetic symbionts. Also described are the molecular biomarkers of thermal stress: oxyradicals and antioxidant enzymes, fluorescent proteins, cytochrome p450 and monooxygenase system, mitochondrial integrity, heat shock proteins, and symbiotic-specific genes. By studying and measuring these biomarkers, early detection of coral degradation is a future possibility (Solayan, 2016).</div><div>Another efficient tool for scientists who want to evaluate the health of an ecosystem is the use of empirical estimated indicators, which are categorizated into primary producers and primary consumers.</div><h3 data-label="850444" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Single trophic level indicators</h3><div>Primary producers are indicators which consist of the phytoplankton and the phytobenthic groups. Tracking phytoplankton’s fast growth rates and response to low levels pollutants, scientists can identify sensitive and early signs­­ of ecological changes and environmental disturbance in marine surface waters (Paerl et al., 2003). Phytobenthic groups are sensitive indicators of changes in marine environments as they  live long and they usually are sessile organisms (Borja et al., 2008; Van Hoey et al., 2010). Macrobenthic communities also undergo chronic disturbances which affect their diversity, total abundance and total biomass and this may help the scientists identify modifications in the trophic structure and functioning of an ecosystem. &nbsp;(Borja et al., 2011; Dauvin, 1998; Pearson and Rosenberg, 1978; Warwick and Clarke, 1994).</div><div>Primary consumer indicators include the zooplankton and zoobenthic groups. In 2005, the professor Weijerman mentioned that the abundance of zooplankton species can be used to document sudden ecosystem shifts in different regions of the world and also help identify the effects of global warming and its consequences on regional hydrodynamics (Beaugrand, 2009). As regard to zoobenthic groups, their structural characteristics can be useful to monitor the impacts of environmental stress in coastal systems ( Dauvin, 2007) and they can also be used in detecting early environmental disturbances, especially in estuarine habitats (Dauvin, 2007; Elliott and Quintino, 2007).</div><h3 data-label="289948" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Two or more trophic level indicators</h3><div>The restriction of using these empirical estimated indicators, however, is that they can demonstrate the state of an ecosystem examining only a single trophic level. The need for assessing the ecosystem health in two or more trophic levels led scientists to introduce different approaches. The use of stable isotope profiles as environmental and trophic indicators is a supporting tool to study feeding habits, nutrient tracking, species migrations and habitat use of species and communities in the ecosystem (Thompson et al., 2005). In addition, modelling techniques have been introduced to study ecosystem responses to different stressors (Christensen et al., 2007). An ecosystem model can be used to compute a group of indicators describing the physical attributes, lower trophic levels (phyto- and zooplankton mainly in pelagic systems), higher trophic levels, and ecosystem principles. Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an indicator would take under different situations. (Rombouts et al., 2013)</div><h3 data-label="617416" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Classification of Ecosystems</h3><div>Another approach, proposed by (Hattam et al., 2015), using the Dogger Bank as a case study, underlines the need to link indicators into three main classifications. Ecosystem services, the first classification, &nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010), ecosystem functions referring to “the ecological processes that control the flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter through an environment” (Cardinale et al., 2012) and ecosystem benefits that are “the products or experiences that people create from ecosystem services and they are no longer functionally connected to the ecosystems” (Haines-Young and Potschin 2013). Identifying sufficient service, function and benefit indicators remains a challenge due to the complexity of marine ecosystems. However, once the proper indicators for each classification are chosen, and they are assessed in conjunction, they can give a more complete understanding of how an ecosystem change (Hattam et al., 2015).</div><h2 data-label="954632" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="622204" class="ltx_title_subsection">Relevant marine ecology principles and concepts
