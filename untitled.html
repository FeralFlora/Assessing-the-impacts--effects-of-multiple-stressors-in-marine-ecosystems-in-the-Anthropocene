<h1 data-label="207427" class="ltx_title_section">Preface</h1><div>Although this report examines the topic of assessing the impacts of multiple stressors from a holistic or ecosystem-based perspective, which is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses, the treatment of the topic can not be considered exhaustive or  comprehensive enough to warrant conclusive assertions on the best practices. This is due to the complex nature and wide scope of the issue compared to the limited timeframe within which the project was conducted. The report does, however, provide an excellent starting point for anyone looking for an overview of the topic with insights into important considerations, various approaches to the issue and how they compare based on critical criteria as well as peripheral topics. However, based on the insights gained throughout the report, we do conclude on preliminary recommendations on approaches to cumulative impact assessments, which we find to be the most promising.</div><h1 data-label="821800" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="821800" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div> &nbsp;                                                                   The assessment of marine stressors has received much attention in recent  years due to their accelerated rise, which has deplorable consequences in the  oceans. It is argued that the scope of human activity  has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level that our impacts on the  biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark history on a  geological timescale. In 2000, the researchers Crutzen and Stoermer first  introduced the word ‘Anthropocene’ (from the Greek word anthropos ‘human being’  and kainos ‘new’) in order to refer to the current time period in which human  impacts are just as important as natural processes **<b>(citation)</b>. In this new era, the  Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of species loss  growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems**.&nbsp;ecosystems**<b>(citation)</b>.&nbsp;</div><div>    In the current climate, the ocean is drastically suffering the consequences of human activities. Varied stressors  affecting marine ecosystems, such as ocean warming, acidification, pollution,  overfishing, etc., are converting them in hostile places with life and diversity  reduction. Additionally, the ocean is a source of resources in terms of alimentation  and medicine, which the society cannot do without it. For that reason, there is  a need to preserve and protect its nature. To this end, it is required to have a broad knowledge  about the present situation and how these changes can affect us.</div><div>    However, few studies have focused on the assessment of multiple stressors,  considering also their potential interactions and cumulative effects. There is  extensive literature on the impacts and effects of single marine stressors, but  there is lack of awareness concerning how they interact, which makes it  difficult to fully evaluate the present and future situation of the ocean.</div><div>            </div>
