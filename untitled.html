</h2><div>                                        </div><div>&nbsp;The Anthropocene,  our current time in earth history, means the era after the Holocene. There are  different approaches for defining this ongoing time.&nbsp;</div><div>    It’s argued that the scope of human  activity has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level that our  impacts on the biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark  history on a geological timescale. In this new epoch, the Anthropocene, humans  have arguably become the main driver of change in the environment.&nbsp;</div><div>    The word ‘Anthropocene’ was  first used by the researcher Paul J. Crutzen in 2002 as assigning “the term  ‘Anthropocene’ to the present, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch,  supplementing the Holocene - the warm period of the past 10-12 millennia.”<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Crutzen_2002}</cite> Different authors already  used similar words before, such as Antonia Stoppani in 1873 speaking about a  “new telluric force which in power and universality may be compared to the  greater forces of earth" (quoted from&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{crutzen2002}</cite>) and V. I. Vernadsky describing the growing impact  of humans through: “The direction in which the processes of evolution must  proceed, namely towards increasing consciousness and thought, and forms having  greater and greater influence on their surroundings.” (quoted from <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Crutzen_2002}</cite>)</div><div>&nbsp;The Anthropocene began with the  industrialisation and James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. The  humans started to expand their use of fossil oils and their CO2 emissions.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007,Crutzen_2002}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Crutzen_2002}</cite>  It is suggested, that the current human impact last for long periods. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    The researchers Steffen,  Crutzen and McNeill are stating that the Anthropocene proceeded in three  different stages. Starting with Pre-Anthropocene events, including the first  major use of fossil fuels, leading to the first stage of the Anthropocene: The  Industrial Era. This stage, mainly described by the industrialization, started  around 1800 and ended around 1945 with the second World War. During this era  humans energy source was massively altered by the expansion of the use of oil,  gas and coil in industry. During the period of time from 1800 until 2000,  humans energy used grew about 40-fold and global economy increased about  50-fold. Related to this, human population registered enormous growth in  numbers. Looking at the impact of the Industrial era on the biosphere by  comparing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the preindustrial era  accounted an atmospheric CO2 concentration about 270-275 ppmv and rose above  300 ppmv until 1950. By the end of the second stage of the Anthropocene, the  Great acceleration, around 2015, the atmospheric CO2 concentration has  increased above 380 ppmv. This extreme rise in numbers is only a small fragment  of the ecological change that happened during the industrial era and the Great  acceleration, but gives a good insight in the scope of the interference.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    During the second stage of  the Anthropocene, humans population has grown over 6 billion, the global  economy experienced a great extension, motorisation proceeded and urban areas  expanded drastically. This stating only a few aspects of this era characterized  by expansion, innovation and discovery. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    “Over the past 50 years,  humans have changed the world’s ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in  any other comparable period in human history.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite>  But how does that apply on marine ecosystems? 71 percent of the earth surface  is covered by water, and the ocean represents 99 percent of earths habitats&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{httpssciencenasagovearth-scienceoceanographyliving-ocean}</cite>, this leads to the  assumption, that marine ecosystem play a major role, concerning the health  status of earths ecosystem. Humans have shaped and effected the marine  ecosystem, rising more and more with human development. For example ''humans  use about 8% of the primary production of the oceans, that fraction grows to  more than 25% for&nbsp; areas and to 35% for  temperate continental shelf systems" <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite>. Furthermore ''22% of recognised marine fisheries were overexploited or already  depleted by 1995, and 44% more were at their limit of exploitation''<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite>.  This shows the great interference of humankind on the marine ecosystem,  especially marine life.&nbsp;</div><div>    Since 2015, we  have entered the third stage of the Anthropocene, named “Stewards of the Earth  System” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite>.  Given by the name of this era, now-a-days humans are seen as “major geological  force” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite>,  shaping the future of the earth system.This stage is described by “growing  awareness” <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep*{Steffen_2007}</cite>,  due to more research, global information-flow, more stable and democratic  governments, integration into policies concerns and social and cultural  concerns. </div><div>    Our current  extraction-consumption based economic&nbsp; model has led to rapid expansion of human  habitation and resource extraction causing detrimental effects on the extent  and integrity of the ecosystems and habitats that enable rich biodiversity and  vital ecosystem services. Furthermore, the resources we extract are often  returned to the environment in such a composition or context that they become  pollutants, which no longer cycle through the systems in an equilibrium or a  beneficial way. Going forward, human activity is likely to cause widespread  mass-extinctions and biodiversity loss with adverse consequences for future  habitability on earth, should we stay on a business as usual course without  altering our ways. Referring to the article “The future of biodiversity”,  currently the Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of  species loss growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm_1995}</cite>,  while the atmospheric concentrations of several important greenhouse gases have  increased substantially. As a result the Earth is warming rapidly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014}</cite> and more nitrogen is now  converted from the atmosphere into reactive forms by fertilizer production and  fossil fuel combustion compared to all of the natural processes in terrestrial  ecosystems put together.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Galloway_2002}</cite></div><div>    Most of the human-induced  stress on marine ecosystems can be ascribed to climate change. Climate change  being one of the major and most discussed catchphrases in our time, shows that  “(..) the recognition that human activities are indeed affecting the structure  and functioning of the Earth System (..) is filtering through to  decision-making at many levels”.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Human activities have had a  significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems; especially in marine ecosystems.  For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source of food and  a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we do. But in  the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the ocean has  limits and that in many important parts of our seas the sustainability  thresholds have been breached.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Doney_2010}</cite>U Ulf Riebesell describes this  impact by defining the Anthropocene in “Ocean change: a mix of interacting  stressors” as “the age in which the human activity on the environment is  comparable to or even greater than natural influences.” Furthermore, he  emphasizes marine ecosystems in this era while describing ocean change as an  ongoing process in the whole history of earth and that the present ocean change  be unique in the modern time. It be the fastest change and perhaps the biggest  influence, that a single species ever had and that species be modern humans –  us. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{riebesell}</cite></div><div>     &nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="298655" class="ltx_title_subsection"><b>Defining The Health of Marine Ecosystems</b></h2><h2 data-label="811231" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h3 data-label="340009" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The Importance of Understanding Ecosystems</h3><div> The marine ecosystem is an important biological system that provides services to humanity as a whole and therefore we  are a&nbsp;beneficiary to the ocean for what it provides; but research today is stressing the urgency for environmental management of this ecosystem due to  the rapidness of its declining state&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>.
