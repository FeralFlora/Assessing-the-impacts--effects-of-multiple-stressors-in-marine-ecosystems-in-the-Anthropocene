<h1 data-label="887908" class="ltx_title_section">Preface</h1><div>Although this report examines the topic of assessing the impacts of multiple stressors from a holistic or ecosystem-based perspective, which is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses, the treatment of the topic can not be considered exhaustive or  comprehensive enough to warrant conclusive assertions on the best practices. This is due to the complex nature and wide scope of the issue compared to the limited timeframe within which the project was conducted. The report does, however, provide an excellent starting point for anyone looking for an overview of the topic with insights into important considerations, various approaches to the issue and how they compare based on critical criteria as well as peripheral topics. Based on the insights gained throughout the report, we do conclude on preliminary recommendations on approaches to cumulative impact assessments, which we find to be the most promising.</div><h1 data-label="821800" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>                                                                  The assessment of marine stressors has received much attention in recent  years due to the accelerated rise of human impacts, which are having dire consequences on the  ocean. It is argued that the scope of human activity  has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level, that our impacts on the  biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark history on a  geological timescale. In 2000, the word ‘Anthropocene’ (from the Greek word anthropos ‘human being’  and -cene from -kainos, ‘new’) was introduced introduced in order to refer to the current time period in which human  impacts are just as important as natural processes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crutzen2000}</cite>. In this new era, the  Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of species loss  growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm1995,Ceballos_2015}</cite>.                                 &nbsp;<cite>Moreover, the rapid population  growth, an alarming 35% more since 1992&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ripple2017}</cite>, makes sustainability  transitions difficult to realise. However, it is not impossible to achieve  positive changes if we evaluate and address the problem</cite><cite>.&nbsp;</cite><cite>This  is the case, for example, of the ozone-depleting substances, which have  decreased since the nineties due to the application of sustainable changes&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ripple2017}</cite>. For that reason, a comprehensive assessment plays a critical role in responding to threats on the biosphere.&nbsp;</cite>       &nbsp;</div><div>    In the current climate, the ocean is drastically suffering the consequences of human activities. Varied stressors  affecting marine ecosystems, such as ocean warming, acidification, pollution,  overfishing, etc., are converting them to hostile places with life and diversity  reduction&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bernal2016}</cite>. Additionally, the ocean is a source of resources in terms of alimentation  and medicine, which the society cannot do without it. For that reason, there is  a need to preserve and protect its nature;  it is necessary to have a broad knowledge  about the present situation and how these changes can affect the humanity.</div><div>                                      The impacts of  stressors in marine ecosystems have been studied&nbsp;<i>a lot</i> during recent years, but only a few studies have focused on  the assessment of multiple stressors, considering also potential stressor  interactions and their cumulative effects. There is extensive literature on the  impacts and effects of single marine stressors, but there is a lack of awareness  concerning how they interact, which makes it difficult to fully evaluate the  present and future situation of the ocean. When different stressors act  together, their consequences are cumulative effects that present non-linear  results and ecological surprises. This leads to the challenging goal of making an  interdisciplinary and holistic approach.</div><div>                 The present paper presents different sets of criteria for multiple stressor assessment in marine ecosystems found by literature review,  describing and evaluating them. Afterwards, several steps are proposed taking into account processes  from various methods. Once this is done, it is implemented in the case study, which is the Great Barrier Reef, showing its applicability.&nbsp;</div><div>                                  &nbsp;<b>Problem formulation, Method and Research  Question</b></div><div>        Human activities  have had a significant impact on the Earth’s ecosystems. So it is now urgent to understand  that the ocean has undergone large physical and biogeochemical modifications in  response to human induced stressors. These stressors encompass ocean surface  warming, changes in ocean salinity, modifications of density structure and  stratification, an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon  concentrations, as well as decreasing seawater pH in response to ocean uptake of  anthropogenic carbon.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite></div><div>    Current approaches  to assessing the risk of anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems are  developed for single stressors. The cumulative impact of several stressors,  however, may differ from the impact of a single stressor and can result in  nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. The complexity of marine systems,  their inherent high variability, and the influence of multiple environmental  factors or stressors suggests that no single measure is adequate for assessing  the effects of multiple stressors on biota.&nbsp;</div><div>    Given this  background, the objectives of this study are to develop and provide a  literature review for assessing the effects of multiple stressors on marine  systems and assist in understanding the cumulative impact of several stressors. In  the Anthropocene, where many stressors are interacting with each other and  everything is connected in a complex web of effects, the methods we apply for  impact assessments must necessarily reflect this reality, in the present and especially  in the times ahead if we are to understand the ongoing changes and where  they will lead us.&nbsp;</div><div>    Therefore, we  collected scientific articles, journals and books for the different  categories of our research topic: the Anthropocene, ongoing changes and future  development, ecosystem health, multiple stressor assessment methods and coral  reefs. To make sure, that everyone gets the same knowledge, we divided the  articles of each topic between the group members and took notes while reading.  Through the writing progress, the topics were switched around, to reinforce each  other knowledge within the scope of our project. In between, the different sections  and especially the results of our project were discussed in several group  meetings.&nbsp;</div><div>    So in the end we were able to answer our  research question: </div><div>    <b>How do we assess the effects of multiple stressors impacting the  marine ecosystem in the Anthropocene?</b></div><div>    This question is  asking for assessment methods, metrics and/or scaling for the health status of  a marine ecosystem affected by multiple stressors. Hereby, we focus on  human-induced stressors, due to the fact that these stressors now-a-days are  the biggest disturbances which challenge marine ecosystems. We want to tackle  and solve this question by finding out firstly what actually defines a healthy  ecosystem and how is ecosystem degradation generally defined. Furthermore, we  need to know what the main stressors affecting the marine ecosystem are, as well as the impact that these harmful consequences can impose but especially how they can interact and intersect.&nbsp;</div><div>    By asking these questions,  we will be able to get a more complex overview of which metrics we have to  include in our assessment of ecosystem health and multiple stressors later on.  With this foundation, we can move on to ask which methods are used or proposed  to evaluate the impacts of multiple stressors in the marine environment.  Moreover, we want to discuss how these methods compare and if these methods can  be generalized to find an overall assessment method. These questions are  elaborating the main particular question for assessment methods and questioning  their effectivity and especially their integrity and perspicuity. Moving on  from that, the question that comes up is, at which levels  the found methods can&nbsp;be applied.</div><div>    Thus, fitting to the  semester binding of our project work, “The application of natural science in  technology and society”, we will try to understand how biology and ecology can  be applied to understand how multiple stressors derived from anthropogenic and  natural causes (agitated by human activities) cumulatively affect marine environments  and, consequently, our society. We will work with multiple stressors which  affect marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene. This means that all the stressors  we are looking at somehow are human induced. Most of the stressors are related  to climate change, for instance: sea level rise, acidification and long term  oxygen depletion. But the stressors also include: overfishing, contamination, and&nbsp;sedimentation due to run-off from agriculture. These  stressors are caused by humans, more precisely, by human technologies. So we  can see that all the mentioned stressors in the example are constructed by us  ourselves – the society and thus our technologies. However, these stressors do  not only affect the marine ecosystem itself but the impacts are falling back on  us as well. In this way, multiple stressors affecting the marine ecosystem in  the Anthropocene becomes a concern that our society is responsible for and we must tackle the challenge that lays before us.&nbsp;</div><div>    </div><h1 data-label="543346" class="ltx_title_section">Methodology</h1><div>                                                                        An abundance of literature reviews and assessments were found as  researching types in our search for methods of assessing multiple stressors in marine ecosystems.&nbsp;At first, we provide a solid background about what is the anthropocene, how and why is important to define a healthy ecosystem and we  display the interactions between multiple stressors, creating a mind-map. Next,&nbsp;we present the different assessment&nbsp; methods we found, describing their function, the way they treat the data and declaring  their pros and cons, providing a solid background of the current assessment frameworks.  The next step is to propose the criteria that a method should meet, discussing  and formulating the ones we found in the research paper “Marine ecosystem services: Linking  indicators to their classification”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam_2015}</cite>. Additionally, we  created a ranking table for the assessment methods, judging them by these  criteria. More specifically, we consider a method as "sufficient" or "insufficient", whether or not, respectively, there is scientific evidence that it satisfies a criterion's properties, "improving" if scientific effort is currently undergoing in the direction of a criterion's fulfilment and "not included" in case we didn't find enough information about a specific criterion. Finally, after having discussed the proposed steps from four different scientific papers, searching for overlappings and new approaches, we propose a methodology for assessing the impacts of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems and focus on Great Barrier Reef, as a case study, to apply these steps.</div><div>"A Phased Approach for Assessing Combined Effects from Multiple Stressors"&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Menzie2007}</cite>  &nbsp;<i>&nbsp;"Assessing the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota: The receptor's side matters"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></i><b><i>&nbsp;"</i></b><i>New approaches to the ecological risk assessment of multiple stressors"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></i><b>&nbsp;"</b><i>The challenges and opportunities in cumulative effects assessment"&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley2017}</cite></i></div><div></div><div>    </div>
