<h1 data-label="207427" class="ltx_title_section">Preface</h1><div>Although this report examines the topic of assessing the impacts of multiple stressors from a holistic or ecosystem-based perspective, which is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses, the treatment of the topic can not be considered exhaustive or sufficiently comprehensive. This is caused by the complex nature and wide scope of the issue compared to the limited timeframe within which the project was conducted. It does, however, provide an excellent starting point for anyone looking for an overview of the topic with insights into important considerations as well as peripheral topics.&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="821800" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>  &nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="940037" class="ltx_title_subsection">The background: Recent events and the ongoing ecological decline
