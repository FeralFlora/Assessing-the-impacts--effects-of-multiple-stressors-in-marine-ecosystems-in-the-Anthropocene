<div>In relation to the aforementioned balancing act between accuracy and practicality, some approaches to the multiple stressor issue take a different route towards describing multiple stressor impacts, namely identifying either a single or a few key indicators of ecosystem health or conversely ecosystem stress to estimate cumulative impacts in this single "currency" across different types of stressor, which all might influence this characteristic or metric. The goal is to identify a measure that is sufficiently universal, sensitive and measurable so as to effective inform assessments of multiple stressor impacts through simple means.</div>
