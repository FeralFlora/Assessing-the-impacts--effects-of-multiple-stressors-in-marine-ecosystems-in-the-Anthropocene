Consequent cascades from one disturbance can cause direct and indirect impacts that impair the services that ecosystems provide. If protection of ecosystem services and the sustainability as a whole is to be successful, we must understand the links between species, comprehend the ecosystem in its entirety, and identify the most efficient and reliable assessment methods.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite></div><h3></h3><h3 data-label="328282" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">                                         Classification of the marine  environment</h3><div>            The ocean is divided between the  environment of the sea bottom,&nbsp;benthic  division, and the rest of the water mass,&nbsp;pelagic division. This last division can be separated in&nbsp;neritic<b>&nbsp;</b>province-water over  continental shelves- and&nbsp;oceanic province-water below continental shelves. Moreover, another vertical distinction is  done creating the&nbsp;intertidal zone,  that lies on the shore and is defined by tidal fluctuations, the&nbsp;photic zone, where there is light  enough to perform the photosynthesis, and the&nbsp;aphotic zone, that lacks sunlight.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sumich2016}</cite></div><div>                                         </div><h3>Spatial classification of  marine organisms</h3><div>            Furthermore marine organisms are classified in three  groups. Firstly,&nbsp;benthos live in the  ocean bottom and can be&nbsp;epifauna if they  are on the surface or&nbsp;infauna if  they live buried.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sumich2016}</cite>&nbsp;Nekton<b>&nbsp;</b>is formed by all the animals  that move freely of the currents and&nbsp;Plankton  comprises all the organisms that drift with water flows.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Webber1991}</cite> Plankton have an  important role in marine biogeochemical cycles, for that reason also affect the  chemical composition of sea water.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Mullin2001}</cite></div><div>  </div>
