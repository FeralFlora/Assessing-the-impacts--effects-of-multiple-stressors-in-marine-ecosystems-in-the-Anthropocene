<div><b>Modelling</b></div><div>The method of modelling is used widely throughout the scientific researching community; it can be used alone or in a combination with other methods. It has a range of abilities, such as: quantification, identification, and assisting in a greater understanding to multiple stressor impacts. </div><div>Quantifying per se chemicals and their interactions or level of disturbances are some performances of the modelling method. Modelling can also assist in identification, threatening stressors and ecological drivers, prioritising areas needing research, and exposure to multiple stressors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{NationalAcademiesofSciencesEngineering2017}</cite>. This method can facilitate the creation of mapping (e.g. conservation resources), predictions (e.g. early-warning)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Yee2010}</cite>, comparisons of potential consequences for different possible scenarios, and mathematical predictions. Ultimately, this model helps with achieving a greater understanding towards potential stressor impacts and how they can effect organisms and communities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{NationalAcademiesofSciencesEngineering2017}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>The framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) encompasses the many uses of the modelling method. Simulations of this model exhibit how the stressors might evolve through the 21st century. Four stressors are measured: sea surface temperature, surface pH, oceanic O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and net primary production (NPP); it applies ten Earth system models within the categories of: historical simulations from 1870 to 2005, all climate change scenarios (RCP), and pre-industrial control simulations; the four representative concentration pathway's (RCP) from the IPCC are measured in CO2 concentration (ppm), which predict different scenario outcomes: RCP8.5 (business-as-usual), RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 (high-mitigation). The model incorporates the variables of annual mean 3D temp, salinity, meridional velocity, pH, carbonate ion, O2, 2D vertically integrated NPP, and the export production of organic particles at 100m. Although caution should be taken in the regional sense with using the CMIP5 models, the results project a consistency throughout the stressing factors: SST warming, pH lowering causing acidification, O2 concentration lowering causing deoxygenation, and NPP also declining but depending on the RCP scenario.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Chen2013}</cite></div><div><b>Cumulative impact mapping&nbsp;</b></div><div>    <i>&nbsp;</i>Cumulative impact mapping, as first presented by the professor Halpern on 2008, is an innovated approach of understanding and quantifying the magnitude and the geographical distribution of human impacts on marine ecosystems. It involves identifying the stressors impacting the region to be mapped or assessed, ranking the stressors based on their severity in relation to the main vulnerabilities of the particular ecosystem or ecosystem component, estimating the stressor impacts' spatial range and, based on the overlapping stressor ranges, estimating the cumulative stress impacts, sometimes expressed as a numerical cumulative impact score. This approach is very helpful in estimating the general level of cumulative impacts in specific regions (or even the global oceans) and it informs us about the areas in the greatest need of management and conservation and mitigation efforts, even providing insights into the most significant single stressors or general driver categories.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2009}</cite>.&nbsp;Tseem relatively simple in that the three steps required are to calculate and map the intensity of  each stressor, map the location of the habitat types in the affected area and then applying a vulnerability  weight (Halpern et al. 2007, Halpern et al. 2008b), but it requires taking into account many assumptions. These  assumptions, respectively, lead to some strengths and limitations that are  presented above.</div><div>The first advantage of this method is its ability to demonstrate its  results in a simple and visualized way. This fact makes these maps a useful  tool for many education programs and also it is east to communicate the extent  of the problem to the community. Furthermore, the framework   proposed by Halpern et al., (2008) can easily  be used and applied to local and regional scale assessment efforts, using a  more solid and integrated database. Another benefit is the ability to transform diverse impacts into the same quantitative score, which allows for simple addition to derive a cumulative impact score.&nbsp;</div><div>At the same time, this transformation, normalization and addition is a significant assumption that scientists make using this method in order  to combine stressors with variable distributions and different measurement  units. Additionally, as scientists have not  yet completely understood when, where or why non-additive responses  (synergistic and antagonistic) occur (Crain et al. 2008, Darling and Cote 2008)  they consider that cumulative stressor impacts are additive. The drawback of these  decisions is that the examined habitats will respond linearly to possible  changes. However, as pointed out earlier, it is quite likely that such linear responses of  ecosystems to multiple stressors are the exception rather than the rule in marine environments and  this could lead to overly conservative assessment results<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern_2013}</cite>. Lastly, cumulative  impact mapping  rarely takes into account historical references or baselines, even though  they are crucial to full understanding how an area is  affected by the various human  impacts since industrialization and intensification of our activities. Of course, there is probably no historical reference point in human history which can be assumed to be a "pristine" state, which is exemplified by&nbsp;</div><div>    </div>
