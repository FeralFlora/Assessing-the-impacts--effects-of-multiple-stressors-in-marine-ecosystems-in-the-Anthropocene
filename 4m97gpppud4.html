<div>The method of modelling is used widely throughout the scientific researching community; it  can be used alone or in a combination with other methods. It has a range of abilities, such as: quantification, identification, creation and assisting in a greater understanding to multiple stressor impacts. Quantifying per se chemicals and their interactions (#3) or level of disturbances are some performances of the modelling method. Modelling can also assist in identification: threatening stressors and ecological drivers (#3), prioritising areas needing research, and exposure to multiple stressors (#4). This method can facilitate the creation of mapping (e.g. conservation resources) (#4), predictions (e.g. early-warning) (#4)(#6), comparisons of potential consequences for different possible scenarios, and mathematical predictions (#4). Ultimately, this model helps with achieving a greater understanding towards potential stressor impacts and how they can effect organisms and communities (#5). The framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) encompasses the many uses of the modelling method. Simulations of this model exhibit how the stressors might evolve through the 21st century. Four stressors are measured: sea surface temperature, surface pH, oceanic O2 concentration, and net primary production (NPP); it applies ten Earth system models within the categories of: historical simulations from 1870 to 2005, all climate change scenarios (RCP), and pre-industrial control simulations; the four representative concentration pathway's (RCP) from the IPCC are measured in CO2 concentration (ppm), which  predict different scenario outcomes: RCP8.5 (business-as-usual), RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 (high-mitigation). The model incorporates the variables of annual mean 3D temp, salinity, meridional velocity, pH, carbonate ion, O2, 2D vertically integrated NPP, and the export production of organic particles at 100m. Although caution should be taken in the regional sense with using the CMIP5 models, the results project a consistency throughout the stressing factors: SST warming, pH lowering causing acidification, O2 concentration lowering causing deoxygenation, and NPP also declining but depending on the RCP scenario.</div><h2 data-label="169489" class="ltx_title_subsection">Novel concepts, conceptual frameworks and meta-methods</h2><div>    <b>Conceptual frameworks</b>    </div><div><b>MARS (Managing Aquatic ecosystems andwater Resources undermultiple Stress) project</b></div><div></div><div>    </div><div></div><h1 data-label="146094" class="ltx_title_section"><i>The following sections are to be integrated and condensed into the appropriate theory sections:&nbsp;         &nbsp;</i></h1><h3><i>Review of the concept of ecosystem health and comparison of various definitions</i></h3><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="427600" class="ltx_title_section">Results and discussion

marine ecosystems </h3><div>Criteria for judging multiple stressor methods</div><div><i><b>(Maybe a better introduction for this section)</b> In this part, we are going to present the criteria that we think a method for assessing  the effects of multiple stressors should meet. In a next level, using  these criteria we will try to create a ranking table for the different categories we found in the section above.&nbsp; This will be a helpful tool for the scientists to choose the appropriate  assessment method for each examined environment. These criteria can be  concluded as:</i></div><ul><li><b>Measurability</b> describes the ability of a  method to use indicators which are simple and cost-effective to  collect  and evaluate and rank.</li><li><b>Sensitivity</b> refers to the ability of a method to provide early  warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple  stressors over time.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Scalability&nbsp;</b>introduces the importance of a method to be applied to a different  scale and still retain its  ability to indicate the change of interest and provide sufficient results for  the whole ecosystem.</li><li> &nbsp;<b>Transferability</b> is the scope that a method  should be useful and easily applied to other  locations and  studies,  giving reliable and quantified information about the examined ecosystem.</li><li>&nbsp;<b>Communicability&nbsp;</b>describes  whether or not the results of an assessment method can be easily communicated  to a wide audience. As multiple stressor issues in most cases affect the communities, information and understanding of the problem from the majority of  the community is a crucial step for further actions.</li></ul><div></div><div>   Except for these criteria, we think that scientists should, also, take into account the different dynamic processes that occur in an environment and consider about the shifting baseline syndrome. More specifically, in some cases, dynamic processes such as oceanographic currents or immigration are fundamentally important and affect  the overall results, as it may      change how a stressor is distributed or spread its impacts among different locations&nbsp;<i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Halpern_2009}</cite></i>. As regard the shifting baseline syndrome, it is not yet clear what baselines should the different methods use as&nbsp;a starting point. Relying exclusively on current data, ignoring the historical  references, may limit our understanding of the ecosystem fuctioning and increase the possibilty of a sudden&nbsp; collapse of the ecosystem services&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dearing_2012}</cite>.</div><div>Furthermore, we believe that a sufficient assessment method should be capable of recognizing whether the interactions between the multiple stressors are synergistic, additive or antagonistic. Having presented the meaning and function of these interactions in the<i>&nbsp;<b>Theory part()</b></i>, it is crucial to include them in the assessement methods, in order to predict more efficiently possible non-linear effects of the multiple stressors and be able to take the correct management decisions in the right time.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Applicability of the  methods</b></div><div>To address the applicability of the various multiple stressor assessment methods at different trophic and ecological organisational levels, it is necessary to comment on the potential applicability of these methods. As we've framed the focus of our project at the ecosystem level, the methods we are interested in should facilitate assessment of cumulative impacts at this level, rather than only provide insights into population or community level impacts and changes. But what exactly is understood by impacts assessments at an ecosystem level, and are such assessments within scientific reach? To assess ecosystem level impacts, it may well be necessary to approach the assessment with a tiered strategy that ends at an ecosystem assessment, but is conducted through stepwise considerations of specific ecosystem components, so  although a specific methodology isn't an ecosystem level impact assessment in and of itself, it may yet be an integral part of the big picture. These questions and considerations will now be addressed.</div><div>As exhaustively explained, the impacts on a specific species' population infer potential impacts on the community it is part of, which then infers potential impacts upon the functioning, structure and stability of the ecosystem the community is part of. Simultaneously, impacts on ecosystem functioning and environmental conditions infer potential impacts on the communities within the ecosystem and the populations that comprise these communities. Although explained by order of complexity, these perturbations may follow more chaotic or unpredictable impact pathways, and may occur in several directions at the same time. Thus, a multifaceted insight into the relationships, dynamics, processes and impact pathways between these various organisational levels and ecosystem components is necessary. The main question, then, is whether or not any particular assessment approach is sufficiently developed to account for the multitude of variables and insights to account for in order to predict or describe multiple stressor outcomes&nbsp; - without ignoring the complexities of stressor interactions, dynamic processes and non-linear responses. If not, which might be likely, the best current multiple stressor impact assessment at the ecosystem level might be a toolbox of select tools for specific sub-assessments, which, when properly combined, provide an ecosystem level overview of the impacts of multiple stressors.</div><div>For ecosystem level assessments to be viable and valuable (informative and predictive or early-warning), the applied methods must be able to reflect conditions and changes at this level. That is, they must strike the aforementioned balance between pragmatic practicality and sufficient accuracy and sophistication in the sense of an optimal limitation of uncertainties from misrepresentative assumptions.</div><div>For the use of indexes and indicators, these can be used either as a diagnostic or "indicative" aid or, when deemed sufficiently representative of the state of the assessed ecosystem, as an assessment method&nbsp;</div><div>Our conclusion on this matter is that the ecosystem level approach is not only a scientific ideal, but is instead central to any understanding of the multiple stressor issue, since it is at this level that the surprising effects, which we want to understand so as to make them not be surprises anymore, arise.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halll}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Martinez-Crego2010}</cite></div><div></div><div>Model and method validations (<b>mesocosm studies, predicting historical changes / events etc.</b>)</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h3 data-label="517576" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> </h3><h3 data-label="837411" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Recommended order and steps in multiple stressor assessments </h3><h3 data-label="837411" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    </h3><div><b>IDEA (Based on AOPs "</b> Interactions between chemical and climate stressors: A role for mechanistic toxicology in assessing climate change risks<b>"):</b></div><ul><li>Make a large, shared database of various impact pathways, each described in a unified way.</li><li>Then, incorporate this database into software that can assemble complex AOPs, integrating the impacts into a prediction of the outcome of the population in question.</li><li>The results might not be accurate, but they can give an inclination of the possible outcomes.</li></ul><div>STEPS:</div><ol><li><b>Stressor ranking and identification (stessor inventory):</b> "Rating impacts in a multi-stressor world: a quantitive assessment of 50 stressors affecting the Great Lakes"</li><li><b>Cumulative impact mapping:</b> "Mapping cumulative human impacts to California Current marine ecosystems"</li><li><b>Ecological network map</b> (conceptual ecosystem or community model)</li><li><b>Interstressor effects and causative relation to potential biological changes</b> (AOPs): "Characterizing driver-response relationships in marine pelagic ecosystems for improved ocean management"</li><li></li></ol><h3 data-label="517576" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">

It is the largest living structure on earth, stretching for over 2300 km in the northern-east region of Australia. While being mostly known for the endless network of coral reefs, its intricate architecture also provides a home for a great amount of animals and plants, creating one of the most biodiverse and complex ecosystem on the planet. Unfortunately&nbsp; the functional biodiversity of the GBR renders its system highly susceptible to even the smallest change in the balance acquired with thousands of years of evolution&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mouillot_2014}</cite>.&nbsp;</div>
