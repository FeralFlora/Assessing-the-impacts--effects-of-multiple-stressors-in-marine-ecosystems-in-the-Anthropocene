<div><b>Modelling</b></div><div>The method of modelling is used widely throughout the scientific researching community; it can be used alone or in a combination with other methods. It has a range of abilities, such as: quantification, identification, and assisting in a greater understanding to multiple stressor impacts. </div><div>Quantifying per se chemicals and their interactions or level of disturbances are some performances of the modelling method. Modelling can also assist in identification, threatening stressors and ecological drivers, prioritising areas needing research, and exposure to multiple stressors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{NationalAcademiesofSciencesEngineering2017}</cite>. This method can facilitate the creation of mapping (e.g. conservation resources), predictions (e.g. early-warning)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Yee2010}</cite>, comparisons of potential consequences for different possible scenarios, and mathematical predictions. Ultimately, this model helps with achieving a greater understanding towards potential stressor impacts and how they can effect organisms and communities&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{NationalAcademiesofSciencesEngineering2017}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>The framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) encompasses the many uses of the modelling method. Simulations of this model exhibit how the stressors might evolve through the 21st century. Four stressors are measured: sea surface temperature, surface pH, oceanic O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and net primary production (NPP); it applies ten Earth system models within the categories of: historical simulations from 1870 to 2005, all climate change scenarios (RCP), and pre-industrial control simulations; the four representative concentration pathway's (RCP) from the IPCC are measured in CO2 concentration (ppm), which predict different scenario outcomes: RCP8.5 (business-as-usual), RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 (high-mitigation). The model incorporates the variables of annual mean 3D temp, salinity, meridional velocity, pH, carbonate ion, O2, 2D vertically integrated NPP, and the export production of organic particles at 100m. Although caution should be taken in the regional sense with using the CMIP5 models, the results project a consistency throughout the stressing factors: SST warming, pH lowering causing acidification, O2 concentration lowering causing deoxygenation, and NPP also declining but depending on the RCP scenario.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Chen2013}</cite></div><div><b>Cumulative impact mapping&nbsp;</b></div><div></div><div>    <i>    </i>Cumulative impact mapping, as first presented by the professor Halpern on 2008, is an innovated approach of understanding and quantifying the magnitude and the geographical distribution of human impacts on marine ecosystems. It involves identifying the stressors impacting the region to be mapped or assessed, ranking the stressors based on their severity in relation to the main vulnerabilities of the particular ecosystem or ecosystem component, estimating the stressor impacts' spatial range and, based on the overlapping stressor ranges, estimating the cumulative stress impacts, sometimes expressed as a numerical cumulative impact score. This approach is very helpful in estimating the general level of cumulative impacts in specific regions (or even the global oceans) and it informs us about the areas in the greatest need of management and conservation and mitigation efforts, even providing insights into the most significant single stressors or general driver categories.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2009}</cite>       </div>
