<div>An abundance of literature reviews and assessments were found as researching types in our search for methods of assessing multiple stressors, which are applicable to the marine ecosystem. Categorising the methods used in multiple stressor assessments into per se a one-size-fits-all type is not particularly useful since they overlap one another and furthermore can be used in diverse reviews and assessments. Therefore, describing the main findings and similarities between them is what we will explain instead, in hopes that there is a proceeding conceptual  method in which could be applied to assessing multiple stressors in the marine environment.&nbsp;</div><div>A similarity found between the literature review and assessments is using a combination of meta-analysis and modelling. Collecting data from multiple sources and creating a model to project an understanding seems to be a popular method for multiple stressor assessments. Although they have this similarity, the assessments also differ by the execution and the methodology specifics. For example, the meta-analysis and modelling direction of research can focus more towards a multivariate study, giving multiple outcome scenarios. In the case of (#1), the conceptual framework of CMIP5 is used to predict multiple carbon dioxide outcome pathways. The scenario predictions within the CMIP5 framework are&nbsp; representative concentration pathways (RCP), which produce multiple outcomes; one being the RCP 8.5 ''business-as-usual'', which forecasts SST +2.73 (±0.72), sea surface pH -0.33 (±0.003) pH unit, global oxygen content -3.45 (±0.44) %, and integrated primary productivity -8.6 (±7.9)%. Additionally, there is the CMIP5  high mitigation scenario, which might help us predict a world if we tackled the multiple stressor concern: RCP2.6. Here, the changes would instead look like SST +0.71 (±0.45)           </div><div><span class="s1"></span>C,</div><div>   </div>
