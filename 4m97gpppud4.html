<div>The method of modelling is used widely throughout the scientific researching community; it  can be used alone or in a combination with other methods. It has a range of abilities, such as: quantification, identification, creation and assisting in a greater understanding to multiple stressor impacts. Quantifying per se chemicals and their interactions (#3) or level of disturbances are some performances of the modelling method. Modelling can also assist in identification: threatening stressors and ecological drivers (#3), prioritising areas needing research, and exposure to multiple stressors (#4). This method can facilitate the creation of mapping (e.g. conservation resources) (#4), predictions (e.g. early-warning) (#4)(#6), comparisons of potential consequences for different possible scenarios, and mathematical predictions (#4). Ultimately, this model helps with achieving a greater understanding towards potential stressor impacts and how they can effect organisms and communities (#5). The framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) encompasses the many uses of the modelling method. Simulations of this model exhibit how the stressors might evolve through the 21st century. Four stressors are measured: sea surface temperature, surface pH, oceanic O2 concentration, and net primary production (NPP); it applies ten Earth system models within the categories of: historical simulations from 1870 to 2005, all climate change scenarios (RCP), and pre-industrial control simulations; the four representative concentration pathway's (RCP) from the IPCC are measured in CO2 concentration (ppm), which  predict different scenario outcomes: RCP8.5 (business-as-usual), RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 (high-mitigation). The model incorporates the variables of annual mean 3D temp, salinity, meridional velocity, pH, carbonate ion, O2, 2D vertically integrated NPP, and the export production of organic particles at 100m. Although caution should be taken in the regional sense with using the CMIP5 models, the results project a consistency throughout the stressing factors: SST warming, pH lowering causing acidification, O2 concentration lowering causing deoxygenation, and NPP also declining but depending on the RCP scenario.</div><h2 data-label="169489" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="169489" class="ltx_title_subsection">Novel concepts, improvements, conceptual frameworks and meta-methods</h2><h3 data-label="402276" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    <b>Conceptual frameworks</b>&nbsp;/ Meta-methods</h3><div>Tiered recommendations:</div><ul><li><i>Assessing the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota: The receptor's side matters&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></i> </li><li><i>A Phased Approach for Assessing Combined Effects from Multiple Stressors&nbsp;</i></li></ul>
