At first, we presented the different  methods we found, describing their function, the way they treat the data and declaring  their pros and cons, providing a solid background of the current assessment frameworks.  The next step was to propose the criteria that a method should meet, discussing  and formulating the ones we found in the research paper “Marine ecosystem services: Linking  indicators to their classification”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam_2015}</cite>. Additionally, we  created a ranking table for the assessment methods, judging them by these  criteria. More specifically, we consider a method as "sufficient" or "insuffiecient"&nbsp; whether or not, respectively, there is scientific evidence that it satisfies a criterion's properties, "improvable" if scientific effort is currently undergone in the direction of a criterion's fulfilment and "not included" in case we didn't find enough information about a specific criterion.&nbsp;</div><div><i>( Proposed Methodology part)</i></div><div>            </div>
