<div>An abundance of literature reviews and assessments were found in our search for methods of assessing multiple stressors, which are applicable to the marine ecosystem. Categorising the methods used in multiple stressor assessments into per se a one-size-fits-all type is not particularly useful since they overlap one another and furthermore can be used in diverse reviews and assessments. Therefore, describing the main findings and similarities between them is what we will explain instead.</div><div></div><div>Also found as an assessment method was expert elicitation, in which selectively chosen experts are given a survey in order to collect data for maybe an impact rating of stressors (#30) or&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3>Characteristics of the methods</h3><div>    </div><div></div><h1 data-label="146094" class="ltx_title_section"><i>The following sections are to be integrated and condensed into the appropriate theory sections:&nbsp;    </i></h1><h3><i>Key stressors and their potential interactions </i></h3><div><i>    Stressor inventory: Mindmap     </i></div><h3><i>Ecological networks and key interactions / dependencies </i></h3><div></div><h3><i>Review of the concept of ecosystem health and comparison of various definitions</i></h3><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="427600" class="ltx_title_section">Results and discussion

In a next level, using  these criteria we will try to create a ranking table for the different categories we found in the section above.&nbsp; This will be a helpful tool for the scientists to choose the appropriate  assessment method for each examined environment. These criteria can be  concluded as:</i></div><ul><li><b>Measurability</b> describes the ability of a  method to use indicators which are easy and cost-effective to measure, collect  and calculate.</li><li><b>Sensitivity</b> refers to the ability of a method to provide early  warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple  stressors over time.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Scalability&nbsp;</b>introduces the importance of a method to be applied to a different spatial scale and still retain its  ability to indicate the change of interest and provide sufficient results for  the whole ecosystem.</li><li>  <b>Transferability</b> is the scope that a method  should be useful and easily applied to other locations and hence studies,  giving reliable and quantified information about all parts of the world.</li><li>&nbsp;<b>Communicability&nbsp;</b>describes  whether or not the results of an assessment method can be easily communicated  to a wide audience. As multiple stressor issues usually affect the communities, information and understanding of the problem from the majority of  the community is a crucial step for further actions.</li></ul><div></div><div>        Except for these criteria, we think that scientists should, also, take into account the different dynamic processes that occur in an environment and consider about the shifting baseline syndrome. More specifically, in some cases, dynamic processes such as oceanographic currents or immigration are fundamentally important and affect  the overall results, as it may      change how a stressor is distributed or spread its impacts among different locations&nbsp;<i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Halpern_2009}</cite></i>. As regard the shifting baseline syndrome, it is yet unclear what baselines should the different methods use as&nbsp;a starting point. Relying exclusively on current data, ignoring the historical  references, may limit our understanding of the ecosystem fuctioning and increase the possibilty of a sudden&nbsp; collapse of the ecosystem services<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dearing_2012}</cite>.</div><div>Furthermore, we believe that a sufficient assessment method should be capable of recognizing whether the interactions between the multiple stressors are synergistic, additive or antagonistic. Having presented the meaning and function of these interactions in the Theory part(), it is crucial to include them in the assessement methods, in order to predict more efficiently pnon-linear effe&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Ingmar: Add: "Does the method assume that cumulative impacts are additive and the stress responses are linear?"&nbsp;</b></div><div>   The criteria is that the method doesn't have these assumptions.
