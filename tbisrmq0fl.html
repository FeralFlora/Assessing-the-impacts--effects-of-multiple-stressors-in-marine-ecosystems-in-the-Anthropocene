<div>Furthermore, when sunlight reaches the Earth’s surface, the world’s oceans absorb some of this energy and store it as heat which is first captivated on the surface but ultimately some of it is spreads into lower depths.  Water has a much higher heat capacity than air, meaning it can absorb larger amounts of heat energy with only a slight increase in temperature&nbsp;although having a great negative impact on some of the fine balanced ecosystems found in the ocean.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
