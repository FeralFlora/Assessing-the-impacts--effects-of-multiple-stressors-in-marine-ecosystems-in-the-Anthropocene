Thus, synthesis challenges are prominent, and a key aspect of overcoming these challenges lies in improving reproducibility, consistency and the ease of collaboration. To do so, researchers working on the Ocean Health Index project applied principles and software from data science, specifically tools that enable collaborative<i> open data science</i>, defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Hampton_2015}</cite> as: "the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers." to better their scientific computing and oversee the necessary complexity of environmental science&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2017}</cite>. Going deeper into the specifics of the methodologies recommended by Lowndes et al. (2017) is not within the scope of this project, but the developments within ecology and other environmental towards assimilation of methodologies derived from data science in general are important trends that facilitate the shift from reductionistic to holistic science. At the same time, the application of these data science methodologies might enable environmental researchers to conduct better, more reproducible (and thus trustworthy) science in less time, which is imperative since time is of the essence in matters of understanding, communicating and acting on our understanding of the ecological issues in the Anthropocene, and how they relate to societal matters. Effective public communication of these matters  has been emphasized by ecologists, witnessing the all-encompassing&nbsp;extent of human impacts, for decades,  advocating for greater interdisciplinary science, and stressing that "Ecology is a discipline with a time limit, because much of what we study, upon which society is dependent, is fast disappearing."&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bazzaz}</cite>.</div><div><b>Work in progress.</b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h3 data-label="269602" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Stressor inventory: Mindmap
