Thus, synthesis challenges are prominent, and a key aspect of overcoming these challenges lies in improving reproducibility, consistency and the ease of collaboration. To do so, researchers working on the Ocean Health Index project applied principles and software from data science, specifically tools that enable collaborative<i> open data science</i>, defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hampton2015}</cite> as: "the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers" to better their scientific computing and oversee the necessary complexity of environmental science.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2017}</cite>&nbsp;Going deeper into the specifics of the methodologies recommended by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Lowndes2017}</cite> is not within the scope of this project, but the developments within ecology and other environmental towards assimilation of methodologies derived from data science in general are important trends that facilitate the shift from reductionistic to holistic science. At the same time, the application of these data science methodologies might enable environmental researchers to conduct better, more reproducible (and thus trustworthy) science in less time, which is imperative since time is of the essence in matters of understanding, communicating and acting on our understanding of the ecological issues in the Anthropocene, and how they relate to societal matters. Effective public communication of these matters  has been emphasized by ecologists, witnessing the all-encompassing&nbsp;extent of human impacts, for decades,  advocating for greater interdisciplinary science, and stressing that "Ecology is a discipline with a time limit, because much of what we study, upon which society is dependent, is fast disappearing."&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bazzaz}</cite></div><div><b>Work in progress.</b></div><div></div><h2 data-label="848109" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multivariate vs. univariate assessments
</h2><div>                                         &nbsp;With ecosystems  affected by multiple stressors with growing individual and cumulative impacts,  there is a greater likelihood of non-linear ecological surprises, which are  hard to predict and may cause change past thresholds of transition from one  ecological state to another. So we need to understand and account for the  cumulative effects of multiple stressors to get a holistic and representative  view on the consequences of human activities upon the natural systems that  constitute our home and the basis of society. Counter to this need, science  tends to be practiced too narrowly, allowing great insight into specifics  without necessarily providing an adequate view of the full picture. Moreover,  we need to be able to assess and predict how marine organisms and their  ecosystems will adapt and respond to different stressors acting in unison, to  make reasonable predictions for the future development of these ecosystems. </div><div>    Multivariate  stressors deal with more than one variable. An example of these models is the practice  of cumulative effects assessment and management (CEAM), a method of modifying  existing tools for univariate stressors, such as environmental impact  assessment (EIA), for specific valued ecosystem components (VECs) for the use  of CEAM. This method tries to assess cumulative effects for multiple actions  using the tools of “encompass indicators, environmental indices, and habitat  suitability models bases on pertinent indices” (Canter et al., 2011). Thus indicators and indices, dealing with only one  variable or metric, are used for environmental studies creating an index or  modelling. Assessing multivariate effects, one can see the potential adaption  of these EIA tools for the usage in CEAM. (Canter et al., 2011)</div><div>    </div><div>So the often found too narrowly research of  scientists, concentrating only on one or a few stressor(s), gives us a great  detailed knowledge about their used tools. Furthermore, they make specific  predictions about future perspectives of ecosystem adaptions. Using this  knowledge and modifying the tools for assessing these univariate stressors to  assess multivariate stressors, one can get a realistic picture of the  cumulative effects and the different stressors interacting to make reasonable  predictions for the future development of these ecosystems.</div><div>            </div>
