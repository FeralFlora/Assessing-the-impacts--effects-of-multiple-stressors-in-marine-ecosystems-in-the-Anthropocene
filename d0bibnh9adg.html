As the preceding sections have shown, the challenges of effectively and accurately assessing and predicting the outcomes of multiple stressors acting in parallel on marine ecosystems lie in the inherent complexity of the task - arising both from the interwoven nature of ecosystems with webbed relationships of direct and&nbsp; indirect interdependence, as well as the overlapping effects of the stressors themselves. The ecosystems affected by multiple stressors can not be assumed to be in any one stable state, when assessed long-term or even inter-annually, as the ongoing effects of human impacts and systemic alterations to the biosphere continue to develop in magnitude, multitude and spatial extent, thus forcing future assessment and management efforts to take on a more holistic, dynamic and earth-system / ecologically insightful approach to avoid non-linear effects and resultant ecological surprises, which might otherwise thwart the  efforts to stave of the ongoing&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ceballos_2015}</cite> (or conservatively, impending&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rothman_2017}</cite>) Sixth Mass Extinction. As a result, given the multivariate nature and complexity of the issue, univariate impact assessments may well be rendered effectively obsolete in most future oceanic contexts, except when conducted as part of  systemic analyses.</div><div>Paradoxically, there is simultaneously a need to pay greater attention to specific characteristics of stressors, biological receptors and their physical environments and the dynamics and interactions between these, and a need to simplify these complexities in a way that allows for effective analysis in an timely manner, balancing holism and information overload. The latter need is underlined by the urgency of the biodiversity and ecosystem stability crisis.</div><div>We'll now consider the conventional approaches to impact assessments and highlight some of their strengths as well as the pitfalls that have inspired the efforts to develop new approaches, both in extension of the existing methods and in novel ways. Thereafter, we'll give a rough outline of general themes in&nbsp;multiple stressor assessments, which are expanded upon in the results and discussion section of the report.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="218717" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conventional ecological risk and impact assessments and their pitfalls&nbsp;</h2><div>Ecotoxicology,&nbsp;"the branch of Toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by  natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human),  vegetable and microbial, in an integral context.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Truhaut1977}</cite>, developed from toxicology's initial focus on the dose-response of individuals within test populations to chemicals into a similar measure for ecological toxicity, where a concentration of a chemical in an environment amounts to a certain degree of toxicity concluding with an ecological risk assessment. Viewed as an attempt at an integration of ecology and toxicology,&nbsp; ecotoxicology has been criticised for being too simplistic - leaning more towards toxicology than ecology and failing to account sufficiently for the categorical difference between an individual and communities, where population size and constitution are deciding factors, rather than the response mode of an individual.</div><blockquote><div>Although research in ecotoxicology has progressed substantially from simplified, single-species laboratory tests, the ecotoxicological data that provide the scientific input to risk assessments are based primarily on such simple tests.</div></blockquote><div>To extrapolate from these simplified single-species laboratory tests to complex ecosystems, two conceptual approaches are generally applied:</div><ol><li>PNECs (Predicted No Effect Concentrations)</li><li>SSDs (Species Sensitivity Distributions)</li></ol><div>PNECs are thresholds that assign the upper concentration limit until which ecological effects remaining unlikely. SSDs are applications of available critical response data such as NOEC (No-Observed-Effect Concentrations) or EC<sub>50</sub>&nbsp;(sublethal response in 50% of the population)<sub>&nbsp;</sub>information, from either prospective or retrospective risk assessments, as a function of chemical concentrations to derive a frequency distribution of affected species. When SSDs are applied, they are used to inform about a concentration that will leave a large fraction (90–95%) of the affected species above the critical-effect threshold, which is interpreted as allowing the continued integrity of intact ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Calow2003}</cite>. As "intact ecosystems" may be in short order today, this assumption may be increasingly unrealistic / optimistic.</div><div>As noted by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Segner2014}</cite> "This approach neglects the fact that toxic chemicals in the environment do not act in isolation, but their impact on biota is modulated by the presence of other biotic and abiotic stressors." Therein lies the major pitfall of the current ecotoxilogical approaches to risk and impact assessments, and the crux of the multiple stressor challenge.</div><div>The challenge is aggravated by changing&nbsp;    environmental conditions     and their increasing variability, brought about by widespread human impacts, as explored in section&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{384501}</span>, with overlapping stressors in most if not all cases&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gutt2015a}</cite>. In specific cases, stressors in localized environments have numbered as high as 23 stressors, with an average of 13 stressors in each location,     specifically in this case along the California Current in the Pacific Ocean&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern_2009}</cite>. This change in environmental conditions, referring to both biochemical and physical characteristics of the marine environment, alters the operation of pollutants with effects on transport, transformation and distribution of these, whilst also altering behavior of native and potential invasive species to disrupt ecosystem composition, species distributions and their habitats&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Couillard2008}</cite>. Furthermore, this change in environmental conditions can affect the vulnerability of aquatic species to toxic chemicals (or xenobiotics, for a more encompassing term)&nbsp; and in turn these may affect aquatic species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and stress&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Couillard2008a,Hooper2013}</cite>, leading to more unpredictable results and otherwise unexpected outcomes and ecological surprises&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Paine1998,Christensen2006}</cite>. Most notably and worrying, these interactions, as described in&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{348089}</span>, can be non-additive, leading to non-linear synergistic effects, which may nudge the state of ecosystems towards (often yet identified) critical thresholds for ecosystem functioning&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Groffman2006}</cite>, although stressor interactions can also be antagonistic&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Porter1999}</cite>. A review by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Crain2008}</cite> found that the addition of a third stressor (in 171 studies where two or more stressors were manipulated in coastal and marine systems) doubled the number of synergistic effects, suggesting that these types of interactions are prominent in nature, where multiple anthropogenic stressors have become the norm in the Anthropocene&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2007}</cite>, again underlining the limited applicability of isolated or limited  stressor studies. &nbsp;</div><div></div><div><b>Work in progress.</b></div><h2 data-label="273940" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="273940" class="ltx_title_subsection">Themes in multiple stressor assessments</h2><div>The challenges of multiple stressor assessments largely arise from or relate to the vast amounts of data involved, from across several related but separate fields with varying focuses along with separate terminologies and methodologies. Thus, synthesis challenges are prominent, and a key aspect of overcoming these challenges lies in improving reproducibility, consistency and the ease of collaboration. To do so, researchers working on the Ocean Health Index project applied principles and software from data science, specifically tools that enable collaborative<i> open data science</i>, defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citealt{Hampton_2015}</cite> as: "the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers." to better their scientific computing and oversee the necessary complexity of environmental science&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lowndes2017}</cite>. Going deeper into the specifics of the methodologies recommended by Lowndes et al. (2017) is not within the scope of this project, but the developments within ecology and other environmental towards assimilation of methodologies derived from data science in general are important trends that facilitate the shift from reductionistic to holistic science. At the same time, the application of these data science methodologies might enable environmental researchers to conduct better, more reproducible (and thus trustworthy) science in less time, which is imperative since time is of the essence in matters of understanding, communicating and acting on our understanding of the ecological issues in the Anthropocene, and how they relate to societal matters. Effective public communication of these matters  has been emphasized by ecologists, witnessing the all-encompassing&nbsp;extent of human impacts, for decades,  advocating for greater interdisciplinary science, and stressing that "Ecology is a discipline with a time limit, because much of what we study, upon which society is dependent, is fast disappearing."&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bazzaz}</cite>.</div><div><b>Work in progress.</b></div><div></div><h2 data-label="848109" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multivariate vs. univariate assessments
