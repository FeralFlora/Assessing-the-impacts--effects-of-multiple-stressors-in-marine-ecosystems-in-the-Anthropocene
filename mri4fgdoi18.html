<div>As previously mentioned, the MMED methodology can be employed to identify present drivers and resultant stressors as indicated by the frequency and prevalence of certain disturbance events over time in the assessed region. Such information can also be obtained by expert elicitation and literature reviews, though such approaches may lack transparency and reliability. If the assessment is conducted over an extended period, the process may also involve sampling and monitoring to determine the present drivers, their spatial extents, temporal frequency and magnitude, if such monitoring has yet to be established and consistently conducted.</div><div></div><div>As the present drivers are identified, the specific resultant stressors and their impacts can the preliminarily&nbsp;described and ranked using expert elicitation, mainly through surveys. Although this approach is inherently subjective, it can be improved through various ways of opinion quantification and strategic indirect questioning. Crucially, the impact ratings are related to the ecosystem model and the specific assessed region through the concept of vulnerability, whereby the impacts aren't seen as inherent properties of the stressors, but rather as emergent phenomena arising from the interaction of the stressors and the affected receptors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2007,Teck2010}</cite>. To strengthen the ecosystem based approach, the established ecosystem model should guide the expert elicitation process early on and throughout. As suggested by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Menzie2007}</cite>, the need to proceed to the subsequent steps of the assessment process may be evaluated as the process progresses. Thus, as the impacts of the identified stressors are ranked, it is worthwhile to evaluate whether or not these individual impacts can sufficiently account for the observed concerns and effects that the problem formulation relates to, although it may be safe to assume that the impacts will be greater than the individual effects in marine ecosystems affected by multiple stressors, as found in the literature review. If the assessment process deems the stressor ranking to be sufficiently reliable, the hierarchy of stressors may identify those stressors that are too insignificant to warrant further inclusion in the assessment. This must be considered carefully, because although it is necessary to simplify the process and eliminate confounding or nuisance factors, a partial goal of  multiple stressor assessments remains to identify seemingly insignificant factors that may have unexpected consequences in multiple stressor contexts.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>If the explanatory ability of the individual stressors fails to encompass the observed impacts and effects, cumulative impact mapping, as described by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Halpern2008}</cite>,&nbsp; can serve as a, still strictly additive, representation of the cumulative effects of the identified stressors - moving incrementally toward greater ecological realism. This step serves primarily to inform the assessment of the spatial ranges of the present stressors and their overlaps, as the assumptions of additivity and linearity likely cause a disparity between estimates of cumulative impacts derived from this method and actual ecological conditions, when assessed empirically&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Clark2016}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>To move beyond the limitations of the previous steps, interaction webs principally similar to the one shown in figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{303973}</span> from the&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{NationalAcademiesofSciencesEngineering2017}</cite>, in this case with regards to&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
