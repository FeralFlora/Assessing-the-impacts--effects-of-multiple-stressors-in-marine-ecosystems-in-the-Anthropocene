<div>  Finally, all the information found and the  work that has been done so far is used in this step to analyze the whole  ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef, including stressors, receptors and their  interactions, in order to quantify the impact and effect of multiple stressors.                                                                      </div><div>There is not a single correct way to  quantify them, but as stated in our results, modelling is the most reliable  method. The combination of statistical and mechanistic models is able to  accurately assess the impact of multiple stressors (<b>citation). </b>Whereas a statistical model will use data from the coral  reef statistically to determine the stressorsâ€™ interactions, a mechanistic  model will use the knowledge of the ecosystem interactions and its biogeochemical  processes to make a mathematical characterization <b>(citation?)</b>. </div><div>            </div>
