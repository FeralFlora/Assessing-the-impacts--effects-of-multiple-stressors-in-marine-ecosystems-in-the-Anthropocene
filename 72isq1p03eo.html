<div>The invention of the diving equipment and technique was an important step and tool for the exploration of the underwater world and thus coral reefs. However, this progress happended just the last 50 years and as a result there are not many quantitative studies  for assessing the reefs before the intensification of Anthropocene      (Jackson et al. 2001). It is notable that even in the early 1960s (first diving-exploration attempts), coral reefs have already been degraded   &nbsp;. Furthermore, a recent research which treat results of extent surveys suggest that a decline from 28.0% to 13.8% has happended in the cover of  corals in GBR during the last 27 years(    The 27â€“year decline of coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef and its causes). Consequently, before starting the assessment procedure, it is vital to look in historical references about all the different factors and elements that are going to be examined in order to prevent misleading assumptions. A usefull tool for this is the "REEF" database, which has been developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in association with CSIRO. It provides  scientists with all the published and  unpublished material available, in relation to the GBR  dating back to the 19th century. Furthermore, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) conducts   long-term monitoring programs, combining natural historical records of the points of interest in GBR, such as coral cover and weather patterns, with advanced technologies(satellite-based mapping and remote sensing techniques). This programs help scientists understand and visualize  GBR's state in a holistic approach.&nbsp;</div>
