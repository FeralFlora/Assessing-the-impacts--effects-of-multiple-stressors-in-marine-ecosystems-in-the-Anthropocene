For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source  of food and a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we  do. But in the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the  ocean has limits and that in many important parts of our seas the  sustainability thresholds have been breached. It is now, urgent to understand  that the ocean has undergone large physical and biogeochemical modifications in  response to human induced stressors. These stressors encompass ocean surface  warming, changes in ocean salinity, modifications of density structure and  stratification, as well as an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon  concentrations and a decrease in seawater pH in response to ocean uptake of  anthropogenic carbon. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite></i></div><div>    <i>Current approaches  to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems are  developed for single stressors. The cumulative impact of several stressors,  however, may differ from the impact of the single stressors and can result in  nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. The complexity of marine systems,  their inherent high variability, and the influence of multiple environmental  factors or stressors suggests that no single measure is adequate for assessing  the effects of multiple stressors on biota. </i></div><div>    <i>Given this  background, the objectives of this study are to develop and provide a  literature review for assessing the effects of multiple stressors on marine  systems and helping to understand the cumulative impact of several stressors. In  the Anthropocene, where many stressors are interacting with each other and  everything is connected in a complex web of effects, the methods we apply for  impact assessments must necessarily reflect this reality, now, and especially  in the times ahead if we are to understand the ongoing changes and where  they’ll lead us. </i></div><div>    <i>Therefore, we  tried to collect scientific articles, journals and books for the different  categories of our research topic: the Anthropocene, ongoing changes and future  development, ecosystem health, multiple stressor assessment methods and coral  reefs. To make sure, that everyone gets the same knowledge, we divided the  articles of each topics between the group members and took notes while reading.  Through the writing progress, the topics were switched around, to check each  other and give everyone the same knowledge. In between, the different sections  and especially the results of our project were discussed in several group  meetings. </i></div><div>    <i>So in the end we were able to answer our  research question: </i></div><div><i></i>    <b><i>How do we assess the effects of multiple stressors impacting the  marine ecosystem in the Anthropocene?</i></b><i> </i></div><div>    <i>This question is  asking for assessment methods, metrics and/or scaling for the health status of  a marine ecosystem affected by multiple stressors. Hereby, we focus on  human-induced stressors, due to the fact that these stressors now-a-days are  the biggest disturbances which challenge marine ecosystems. We want to tackle  and solve this question by finding out firstly what actually defines a healthy  ecosystem and how is ecosystem degradation generally defined. Furthermore, we  need to know, what the main stressors affecting the marine ecosystem are, what  the impacts of these harmful consequences are and especially how these do  interact and might intersect. </i></div><div>    </div><div><i>By asking these questions,  we will be able to get a more complex overview of which metrics we have to  include in our assessment of ecosystem health and multiple stressors later on.  With this foundation, we can move on to ask which methods are used or proposed  to evaluate the impacts of multiple stressors in the marine environment.  Moreover, we want to discuss how these methods compare and if these methods can  be generalized to find an overall assessment method. These questions are  elaborating the main particular question for assessment methods and questioning  their effectivity and especially their integrity and perspicuity. Moving on  from that, the question that comes up is: at which levels can the found methods  be applied? </i></div><div>    </div><div><i>Thus, fitting to the  semester binding of our project work, “The application of natural science in  technology and society”, we will try to understand how biology and ecology can  be applied to understand how multiple stressors derived from anthropogenic and  natural causes (agitated by human activities) cumulatively affect marine environments  and, consequently, our society. We will work with multiple stressors which  affect marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene. This means that all the stressors  we are looking at somehow are human induced. Most of the stressors are related  to climate change, for instance: sea level rise, acidification and long term  oxygen depletion. But the stressors also include: overfishing, contamination  and sedimentation, due to run-off from agriculture, and forestry. These  stressors are caused by humans, more precisely, by human technologies. So we  can see that all the mentioned stressors in the example are constructed by us  ourselves – the society and thus our technologies. However, these stressors do  not only affect the marine ecosystem itself but the impacts are falling back on  us as well. In this way, multiple stressors affecting the marine ecosystem in  the Anthropocene becomes a concern that our society has to be aware of. </i></div><div>            </div>
