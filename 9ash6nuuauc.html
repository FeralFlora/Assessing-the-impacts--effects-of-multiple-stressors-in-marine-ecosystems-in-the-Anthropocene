<h3>&nbsp;</h3><div>                                        </div><div><b>Problem formulation, Method and Research  Question</b></div><div>        Human activities  have had a significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems; especially in marine  ecosystems. For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source  of food and a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we  do. But in the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the  ocean has limits and that in many important parts of our seas the  sustainability thresholds have been breached. It is now urgent to understand  that the ocean has undergone large physical and biogeochemical modifications in  response to human induced stressors. These stressors encompass ocean surface  warming, changes in ocean salinity, modifications of density structure and  stratification, as well as an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon  concentrations and a decrease in seawater pH in response to ocean uptake of  anthropogenic carbon.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite></div><div>    Current approaches  to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems are  developed for single stressors. The cumulative impact of several stressors,  however, may differ from the impact of the single stressors and can result in  nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. The complexity of marine systems,  their inherent high variability, and the influence of multiple environmental  factors or stressors suggests that no single measure is adequate for assessing  the effects of multiple stressors on biota. </div><div>    Given this  background, the objectives of this study are to develop and provide a  literature review for assessing the effects of multiple stressors on marine  systems and helping to understand the cumulative impact of several stressors. In  the Anthropocene, where many stressors are interacting with each other and  everything is connected in a complex web of effects, the methods we apply for  impact assessments must necessarily reflect this reality, now, and especially  in the times ahead if we are to understand the ongoing changes and where  they’ll lead us. </div><div>    Therefore, we  tried to collect scientific articles, journals and books for the different  categories of our research topic: the Anthropocene, ongoing changes and future  development, ecosystem health, multiple stressor assessment methods and coral  reefs. To make sure, that everyone gets the same knowledge, we divided the  articles of each topics between the group members and took notes while reading.  Through the writing progress, the topics were switched around, to check each  other and give everyone the same knowledge. In between, the different sections  and especially the results of our project were discussed in several group  meetings. </div><div>    So in the end we were able to answer our  research question: </div><div>    <b>How do we assess the effects of multiple stressors impacting the  marine ecosystem in the Anthropocene?</b> </div><div>    This question is  asking for assessment methods, metrics and/or scaling for the health status of  a marine ecosystem affected by multiple stressors. Hereby, we focus on  human-induced stressors, due to the fact that these stressors now-a-days are  the biggest disturbances which challenge marine ecosystems. We want to tackle  and solve this question by finding out firstly what actually defines a healthy  ecosystem and how is ecosystem degradation generally defined. Furthermore, we  need to know what the main stressors affecting the marine ecosystem are, what  the impacts of these harmful consequences are and especially how these do  interact and might intersect.&nbsp;</div><div>    By asking these questions,  we will be able to get a more complex overview of which metrics we have to  include in our assessment of ecosystem health and multiple stressors later on.  With this foundation, we can move on to ask which methods are used or proposed  to evaluate the impacts of multiple stressors in the marine environment.  Moreover, we want to discuss how these methods compare and if these methods can  be generalized to find an overall assessment method. These questions are  elaborating the main particular question for assessment methods and questioning  their effectivity and especially their integrity and perspicuity. Moving on  from that, the question that comes up is, at which levels  the found methods can&nbsp;be applied.</div><div>    Thus, fitting to the  semester binding of our project work, “The application of natural science in  technology and society”, we will try to understand how biology and ecology can  be applied to understand how multiple stressors derived from anthropogenic and  natural causes (agitated by human activities) cumulatively affect marine environments  and, consequently, our society. We will work with multiple stressors which  affect marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene. This means that all the stressors  we are looking at somehow are human induced. Most of the stressors are related  to climate change, for instance: sea level rise, acidification and long term  oxygen depletion. But the stressors also include: overfishing, contamination  and sedimentation, due to run-off from agriculture, and forestry. These  stressors are caused by humans, more precisely, by human technologies. So we  can see that all the mentioned stressors in the example are constructed by us  ourselves – the society and thus our technologies. However, these stressors do  not only affect the marine ecosystem itself but the impacts are falling back on  us as well. In this way, multiple stressors affecting the marine ecosystem in  the Anthropocene becomes a concern that our society has to be aware of. </div><div>            </div><h1 data-label="546314" class="ltx_title_section">Theory

</h2><div>                              “Over the past 50 years,  humans have changed the world’s ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in  any other comparable period in human history.”&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite>  But how does that apply to marine ecosystems? Around 70 percent of the earth surface  is covered by water, and the ocean represents roughly 99 percent of earths habitats, hence  marine ecosystems play a major role, concerning the health  status of earth's biosphere.&nbsp;</div><div>It’s argued that the scope of human  activity has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level that our  impacts on the biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark  history on a geological timescale. In this new epoch, the Anthropocene, humans  have arguably become the main driver of change in the environment.&nbsp;</div><div>    The word ‘Anthropocene’ was  first used by the researcher Paul J. Crutzen in 2002 as assigning the term  ‘Anthropocene’ to                                     our current, mainly human influenced period  following the Holocene. Different authors already  used similar words before, such as Antonia Stoppani in 1873 speaking about a                                     new kind of influence on earth comparable to  natural influences and V. I. Vernadsky describing the growing impact of humans as  an evolutionary process on earth. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crutzen_2002}</cite>         </div><div>The Anthropocene began with the  industrialization and James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. Humans started to expand their use of fossil fuels and their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007,Crutzen_2002}</cite>&nbsp;It is suggested, that the current human impact last for long periods.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    The researchers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Steffen_2007}</cite>&nbsp;argue that the Anthropocene proceeded in three  different stages. Starting with Pre-Anthropocene events, including the first  major use of fossil fuels, leading to the first stage of the Anthropocene: The  Industrial Era. This stage, mainly described by the industrialization, started  around 1800 and ended around 1945 with the second World War. During this era  humans' energy sources were massively altered by the expansion of the use of oil,  gas and coal in industry. During the period of time from 1800 until 2000,  human energy use grew about 40-fold and global economy increased about  50-fold. Related to this, human population registered enormous growth in  numbers. Looking at the impact of the Industrial era on the biosphere by  comparing the                                     CO<sub>2</sub>         concentration in the atmosphere, the preindustrial era had an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration about 270-275 ppmv and rose above  300 ppmv until 1950. By the end of the second stage of the Anthropocene, the  Great acceleration, around 2015, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has  increased above 380 ppmv and is nowadays about 407 ppmv. This extreme rise in numbers is only a small fragment  of the ecological, biogeochemical and climatic change that happened during the industrial era and the Great  acceleration, but gives a good insight in the scope of the interference with natural cycles like the carbon cycle.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    During the second stage of  the Anthropocene, the global human population has grown to over 6 billion, the global  economy experienced a great extension, motorization proceeded and urban areas  expanded drastically, leading to widespread habitat loss. This stating only a few aspects of this era characterized  by expansion, innovation and discovery.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>                                           Humans have shaped and affected the marine  ecosystem and thereby marine life, rising more and more with human development. For example about 8% of  the primary production of the oceans is used by humans, while that fraction  grows to more than 25% in certain areas and for the temperate continental shelf systems to  more than one third. Furthermore, by 1995 one fifth of known marine fisheries  were overexploited or already exhausted and 44% were at a critical threshold.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite> This shows the great interference of humankind with the marine ecosystem,  especially marine life.</div><div>    Since 2015, we  have entered the third stage of the Anthropocene, named 'Stewards of the Earth  System'.

This stage is described by growing  awareness, due to more research, global information-flow, more stable and democratic  governments, integration into policies concerns and social and cultural  concerns.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Our current  extraction-consumption based economic&nbsp;model has led to rapid expansion of human  habitation and resource extraction causing detrimental effects on the extent  and integrity of the ecosystems and habitats that enable rich biodiversity and  vital ecosystem services. Furthermore, the resources we extract are often  returned to the environment in such a composition or context that they become  pollutants, which no longer cycle through the systems in an equilibrium or a  beneficial way. Going forward, human activity is likely to cause widespread  mass-extinctions and biodiversity loss with adverse consequences for future  habitability on earth, should we stay on a business as usual course without  altering our ways.

Underlying of Ecosystem health is the idea, that ecosystems have an optimal, healthy and natural state, which is urged to protect and retain. But what means healthy in this context and what kind of properties has a marine ecosystem to display to be classified as healthy? Marine Ecosytem health is difficult to define, because as an open system, it is in a constant flux and exchange with its surrounding. Furthermore there are different perceptions of the elements which belong to a marine ecosystem. Generally it can be said that a marine ecoystems consists of the abiotic environment and the biotic community but its argued if this includes humans as a property of this constuct as well. Based on this, marine ecosystem health is not seen as a single feature, but as the sum of contributions of the biotic community, meaning individuals and populations and the abiotic processes within the system.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>A healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite> &nbsp;</div><div>As  it is beneficial to understand where an ecosystem was prior to  stressors, there are common symptoms in which signal ecosystem  degradation; they have been identified from reoccurring stressor impacts  and described with the ecosystem distress syndrome concept.</div><div>Degradative symptoms characterise many ecosystems that are experiencing multiple stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Rapport_1992}</cite>  claims that aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome can include some or  most of the symptoms listed: alteration in biotic community structure to  favor smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by  'r' selected species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened  food-chain length, increased disease prevalence, and reduced population  stability.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite> </div><div>To assess the dilemmas which are faced when understanding&nbsp; ecosystem health the application of a human health metaphor is suggested. There are three fundamental issues which are proposed: recognizing the absence of objective criteria for assessing health indicators, recognizing when changes are actual or a false alarm, and the quest to find classifying indicators with attributes of being holistic, early warning or diagnostic.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><div>Above those issues, we  face a two-fold challenge of boosting ecosystem behaviour and multiple stressor knowledge and working on the development of an identification system of indicators while we deal with the anthropogenic stressors which impact the integrity of biological ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><h3>       Ecosystem Indicators</h3><div>Scientists’  interest in choosing appropriate indicators for evaluating the  ecosystem health has grown over the last two decades and nowadays  ecological indicators are used widely to communicate information about  ecosystems and the impact human activity has on them. Indicators are  usually used to track negative change or degradation of an ecosystem.  They often demonstrate damage that has already occurred and provide  little information about future degradation.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>For  better results and precise outcomes in the evaluation process,  indicators must be carefully selected, in order to represent ­­­the  various aspects of an ecosystem. Any indicator should be sensitive  enough to provide an early warning of change,&nbsp;be able to detect changes  over a wide geographical area and capable of providing a continuous  assessment over many different  stressors. Furthermore, an indicator  should be relatively independent of sample size, easy and cost-effective  to measure, collect and calculate and able to understand the  differences between the natural cycles or trends and the human  induced  stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3>Biomarkers</h3><div>Thermal  stress is one indicator in the present height of research and concern.  As anthropogenic activity increases the temperature of the ocean, many  marine communities show signs of stress as an effect of the ocean  absorbing carbon dioxide. Evaluating certain aspects of the ocean can  help us understand, predict, and hopefully slow down the impacts imposed  by human existence. But how can we start evaluation of stress?  Researchers look for biomarkers which can indicate &nbsp;environmental  change.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sammarco2013}</cite></div><div>Physical  appearance is a possible key biomarker, a quantifiable characteristic  in which can be measured and  can help identify a biological process,&nbsp;  of stressor impacts on coral reefs as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Cooper2009}</cite>  point out a prime example of this in the symbiotic relationship between  corals and microalgae, and the joint pigmentation they produce. Within  coral live photosynthetic dinoflagellate, a type of microscopic algae.  The two organisms live in symbiosis; the coral providing accommodation,  carbon dioxide, and nutrients while the algae supply molecular oxygen  produced by photosynthesis and also fixed carbon which aids in the  coral’s energy requirements.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sammarco2013,Solayan2016,corals}</cite>  Brightness in corals is a direct effect of the corals having  light-absorbing compounds that result in pigmentation but they are aided  by the pigments found in their symbiont photosynthetic microscopic  organisms.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>  Measuring this pigmentation is a potential assessment tool in assessing  water quality and furthermore, the overall health of the ecosystem.  Water quality is defined as a change in its chemistry, including changes  in the concentration of the amount of nutrients, rates of sedimentation  and levels of turbidity’. Considering that the symbiotic pair is  sensitive to water quality shifting, any changes will directly affect  the microorganisms in the possible changes described before. Therefore,  by measuring the pigmentation of both coral and the microscopic algae,  one can gain an understanding of the surrounding water quality.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>.</div><div>Another  efficient tool for scientists who want to evaluate the health of an  ecosystem is the use of empirical estimated indicators, which are  categorized into primary producers and primary consumers.</div><h3><b>Trophic level indicators</b></h3><div>   Organisms are organized in  different&nbsp;trophic levels according  to their feeding relationships.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Trites2001}</cite>  The energy in the  ocean is transferred by photoautotrophic organisms,  or&nbsp;primary producers, placed in the first trophic level to  herbivores,  or&nbsp;primary consumers, that  form the second trophic level. They are  followed by the carnivores, also called&nbsp;secondary and tertiary  consumers,  that occupy the third and last trophic level. In addition,  there is a group  called&nbsp;decomposers, existing on  waste and dead  remains, that breakdown all the organic matter.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sumich2016}</cite>   All of them form a&nbsp;food web in which all the organisms  rely on the  organic matter produced by primary producers.

These  interactions are&nbsp;symbiotic  if at  least one of the involved species is benefited.

Ecosystem services, the  first classification, &nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of  ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010). Ecosystem functions, the  second classification refers to ecological mechanisms which regulate the  flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cardinale2012}</cite>   . The classification ecosystem benefits describes the processed output  from ecosystem services, which is therby no longer linked to the  ecosystem  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haines-Young2012}</cite>  . Identifying sufficient service, function and benefit indicators  remains a challenge due to the complexity of marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</div><div>However,  once the proper indicators for each classification are chosen, and they  are assessed in conjunction, they can give a more complete  understanding of how an ecosystem changes.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>                                        This change  leads us to the  different impacts causing the ecosystem change and their short and long  term considerations.</div><h3 data-label="455145" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Short term and long term considerations</h3><div>                                        &nbsp;As already  shown before, using an already known concept to describe a new problem could  help to simplify and understand several complex topics. So there was an  application of a human health metaphor suggested to transfer this on assessing  ecosystem health using different indicators. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite></div><div>    Due  to the fact, that the main research goal of this project is to contribute to  greater understanding of how to assess the impacts and effects of multiple  stressors in marine ecosystems in our current time of climate and environmental  change, we should try to simplify this complex web of different stressors  interacting with each other to get a general overview of the ongoing changes.  Thus, it is beneficial to review the concept of assessing ecosystem health to  understand the assessing of multiple stressors and their interactions.</div><div>    The  “aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome” lists different symptoms characterizing  ecosystem health, such as: alteration in biotic community structure to favour  smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by ‘r’ selected  species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened food-chain length,  increased disease prevalence, and reduced population stability.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite>&nbsp;All these  symptoms are abiotic and biotic factors in ecosystems and there are more, such  as temperature, pH, nutrients, gas concentration, species concurrence,  migration, etc. For all these abiotic and biotic factors one can apply the maxim for complex metabolic or ecosystem processes, called  “Blackman’s principle”. According to this principle, the rate of the process is  limited by the pace of the slowest abiotic or biotic factor, when the process  is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors. Blackman used this principle specifically to describe the metabolic process of photosynthesis.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{BLACKMAN_1905}</cite>&nbsp;To  illustrate this, imagine a large wine cask, where one of the planks is shorter  than the others. This means it is not possible to fill more wine in the cask  than the high of the shortest plank. The shortest plank in this case functions  as a metaphor for the limiting abiotic or biotic factor.&nbsp;</div><div>    Transferring  this concept to an ecosystem with multiple interacting stressors, this could  help to find a method for assessing multiple stressors and improve their  impacts and effects on marine ecosystems. Considering different ways of  classifying, grouping, quantifying and understanding stressors and the systems  they impact at various organizational levels, according to the Blackman’s  principle, there (probably) is a limiting factor. </div><div>    In a  study of the Australian Institute of Marine Science it is mentioned, that in a  short time perspective, it could help to improve local stressors with an acute  impact in marine ecosystems, but in long term there is most likely a  stabilization of the ocean temperature needed to prevent the coral losses in  marine ecosystems, because, in this case, temperature as a stressor causes a  lot of other negative impacts and effects on the marine ecosystems. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{De_ath_2012}</cite>&nbsp;Thus, temperature would be the limiting factor or stressor. This means, even if  one, theoretically, improves all other stressors, in a long term perspective not  all changes in the ecosystem health could be prevented, due temperature rise  would still have a quite big impact on the condition of the ecosystem. </div><div>    The  Blackman’s principle thus gives us a general idea on how to improve ecosystem  health and minimize the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in a long  term perspective by finding the limiting stressor, which is most likely the  rise of temperature.</div><div>    So  all in all, the concept of ecosystem health could be useful to be able to  assess and predict how marine organisms and their ecosystems will adapt and  respond to different stressors acting in unison, and also which the most significant  or substantial ones are, so we can suggest a systematic framework of these  colossal changes to integrate the effects less universal stressors into.</div><h1 data-label="147465" class="ltx_title_section">                        </h1><div></div><h1 data-label="147465" class="ltx_title_section">Key stressors and potential interactions</h1><h2 data-label="765431" class="ltx_title_subsection"> &nbsp;</h2><div>                          Key stressors and potential interactions        The complexity of the assessment of  multiple stressors lies in the complexity of the interactions themselves.<i>&nbsp;</i>Even though great advances in this  field have been done, most accumulative effects of mutual influences between  stressors remains uncertain.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>First of all, stressors are defined as “any  external abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its  normal operating range” <a href="#Segner2014"><i>(Segner et al., 2014)</i></a> It is important to differentiate the concepts: stressor, stress, and stress  response.&nbsp;While a stressor is an external factor,&nbsp;stress is an  internal state created by a stressor, and&nbsp;stress response is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress.&nbsp;<a href="#StraalenN__dot__M__dot__2003"><i>(Straalen N.M., 2003)</i></a></div><div>    We can group marine stressors in two main  categories: a group that acts globally such as increased temperature, ocean  deoxygenation (the global trend of decreasing oxygen as a result of ocean  warming and increasing stratification) and ocean acidification; and those that  act at a local to regional level but occur globally, such as overfishing which  is responsible of species loss and population collapse due to the chain effect  it has on all the food chain, pollution and hypoxia.&nbsp;<a href="#Porter1999"><i>(Porter  et al., 1999)</i></a></div><div>    In order to evaluate the several effects of  multiple stressors, three classifications based on the impacts upon one  another have been done; called synergistic, antagonistic, and additive effects.  Moreover, these effects are also determined by temporal patters, such as if they are simultaneous or continuous,  and the strength of the stressor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite></div><div>    Synergistic interactions have an effect  greater than the sum of the stressors separated, as in the case of the  interaction between ocean acidification and ocean warming. In situations with  three or more stressors, synergies are expected to be the most prevalent  interaction type.     &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{i2017}</cite>&nbsp;  On the  other hand, in antagonistic interactions, stressors reduce one another effects.  This may be the case where the first of two or more consecutively stressors  preadapt the receptors so they present tolerance to the next ones. Moreover, we  can observe it in the ocean between nutrients and toxins, where the negative  effect of toxins is counterbalanced with the positive effect of nutrients.&nbsp;    &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{i2017}</cite>&nbsp; Lastly,  additive interactions are the sum of the effects and have no additional strength.  Interactions between different chemicals, for example, use to be additive.     &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{i2017}</cite>&nbsp;   &nbsp;</div><div>    Previously, it has been stated the demanding task of understanding the whole picture of stressors' mutal influences. For this reason, in order to have a wide overview  of the marine stressors and their interactions, we have generated a mind map&nbsp; (Fig. 1). The principal purpose of this diagram is to provide as comprehensive  a picture as possible of the complexity of the overall situation, rather than  listing all the effects and consequences between different stressors. This is  partly due to the lack of information about their cumulative effects in  addition to the countless possibilities and variations.</div><div></div>
