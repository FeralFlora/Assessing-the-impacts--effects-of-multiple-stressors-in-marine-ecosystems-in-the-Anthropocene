<h3></h3><div>                                        </div><div><b>Problem formulation, Method and Research  Question</b></div><div>        Human activities  have had a significant impact on the earth’s ecosystems; especially in marine  ecosystems. For centuries, ocean have been regarded as an inexhaustible source  of food and a convenient dumping ground, too vast to be affected by anything we  do. But in the last few decades, it has become increasingly clear that the  ocean has limits and that in many important parts of our seas the  sustainability thresholds have been breached. It is now, urgent to understand  that the ocean has undergone large physical and biogeochemical modifications in  response to human induced stressors. These stressors encompass ocean surface  warming, changes in ocean salinity, modifications of density structure and  stratification, as well as an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon  concentrations and a decrease in seawater pH in response to ocean uptake of  anthropogenic carbon. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Doney_2010}</cite></div><div>    Current approaches  to assess the risk of anthropogenic stressors to marine ecosystems are  developed for single stressors. The cumulative impact of several stressors,  however, may differ from the impact of the single stressors and can result in  nonlinear effects and ecological surprises. The complexity of marine systems,  their inherent high variability, and the influence of multiple environmental  factors or stressors suggests that no single measure is adequate for assessing  the effects of multiple stressors on biota. </div><div>    Given this  background, the objectives of this study are to develop and provide a  literature review for assessing the effects of multiple stressors on marine  systems and helping to understand the cumulative impact of several stressors. In  the Anthropocene, where many stressors are interacting with each other and  everything is connected in a complex web of effects, the methods we apply for  impact assessments must necessarily reflect this reality, now, and especially  in the times ahead if we are to understand the ongoing changes and where  they’ll lead us. </div><div>    Therefore, we  tried to collect scientific articles, journals and books for the different  categories of our research topic: the Anthropocene, ongoing changes and future  development, ecosystem health, multiple stressor assessment methods and coral  reefs. To make sure, that everyone gets the same knowledge, we divided the  articles of each topics between the group members and took notes while reading.  Through the writing progress, the topics were switched around, to check each  other and give everyone the same knowledge. In between, the different sections  and especially the results of our project were discussed in several group  meetings. </div><div>    So in the end we were able to answer our  research question: </div><div>    <b>How do we assess the effects of multiple stressors impacting the  marine ecosystem in the Anthropocene?</b> </div><div>    This question is  asking for assessment methods, metrics and/or scaling for the health status of  a marine ecosystem affected by multiple stressors. Hereby, we focus on  human-induced stressors, due to the fact that these stressors now-a-days are  the biggest disturbances which challenge marine ecosystems. We want to tackle  and solve this question by finding out firstly what actually defines a healthy  ecosystem and how is ecosystem degradation generally defined. Furthermore, we  need to know, what the main stressors affecting the marine ecosystem are, what  the impacts of these harmful consequences are and especially how these do  interact and might intersect. </div><div>    By asking these questions,  we will be able to get a more complex overview of which metrics we have to  include in our assessment of ecosystem health and multiple stressors later on.  With this foundation, we can move on to ask which methods are used or proposed  to evaluate the impacts of multiple stressors in the marine environment.  Moreover, we want to discuss how these methods compare and if these methods can  be generalized to find an overall assessment method. These questions are  elaborating the main particular question for assessment methods and questioning  their effectivity and especially their integrity and perspicuity. Moving on  from that, the question that comes up is: at which levels can the found methods  be applied? </div><div>    Thus, fitting to the  semester binding of our project work, “The application of natural science in  technology and society”, we will try to understand how biology and ecology can  be applied to understand how multiple stressors derived from anthropogenic and  natural causes (agitated by human activities) cumulatively affect marine environments  and, consequently, our society. We will work with multiple stressors which  affect marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene. This means that all the stressors  we are looking at somehow are human induced. Most of the stressors are related  to climate change, for instance: sea level rise, acidification and long term  oxygen depletion. But the stressors also include: overfishing, contamination  and sedimentation, due to run-off from agriculture, and forestry. These  stressors are caused by humans, more precisely, by human technologies. So we  can see that all the mentioned stressors in the example are constructed by us  ourselves – the society and thus our technologies. However, these stressors do  not only affect the marine ecosystem itself but the impacts are falling back on  us as well. In this way, multiple stressors affecting the marine ecosystem in  the Anthropocene becomes a concern that our society has to be aware of. </div><div>            </div><h1 data-label="546314" class="ltx_title_section">Theory

Around 70 percent of the earth surface  is covered by water, and the ocean represents roughly 99 percent of earths habitats, hence  marine ecosystems play a major role, concerning the health  status of earth's biosphere.&nbsp;</div><div>It’s argued that the scope of human  activity has reached such a pervasive and all-encompassing level that our  impacts on the biosphere and the physical characteristics of Earth will mark  history on a geological timescale. In this new epoch, the Anthropocene, humans  have arguably become the main driver of change in the environment.&nbsp;</div><div>    The word ‘Anthropocene’ was  first used by the researcher Paul J. Crutzen in 2002 as assigning the term  ‘Anthropocene’ to                                     our current, mainly human influenced period  following the Holocene. Different authors already  used similar words before, such as Antonia Stoppani in 1873 speaking about a                                     new kind of influence on earth comparable to  natural influences and V. I. Vernadsky describing the growing impact of humans as  an evolutionary process on earth. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crutzen_2002}</cite>         </div><div>The Anthropocene began with the  industrialization and James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784. The  humans started to expand their use of fossil fuels and their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007,Crutzen_2002}</cite>&nbsp;It is suggested, that the current human impact last for long periods.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    The researchers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Steffen_2007}</cite>&nbsp;are stating that the Anthropocene proceeded in three  different stages. Starting with Pre-Anthropocene events, including the first  major use of fossil fuels, leading to the first stage of the Anthropocene: The  Industrial Era. This stage, mainly described by the industrialization, started  around 1800 and ended around 1945 with the second World War. During this era  humans' energy sources were massively altered by the expansion of the use of oil,  gas and coil in industry. During the period of time from 1800 until 2000,  human energy use grew about 40-fold and global economy increased about  50-fold. Related to this, human population registered enormous growth in  numbers. Looking at the impact of the Industrial era on the biosphere by  comparing the                                     CO<sub>2</sub>         concentration in the atmosphere, the preindustrial era  accounted an atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration about 270-275 ppmv and rose above  300 ppmv until 1950. By the end of the second stage of the Anthropocene, the  Great acceleration, around 2015, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has  increased above 380 ppmv and is nowadays about 407 ppmv. This extreme rise in numbers is only a small fragment  of the ecological change that happened during the industrial era and the Great  acceleration, but gives a good insight in the scope of the interference with natural cycles like the carbon cycle.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    During the second stage of  the Anthropocene, the global human population has grown to over 6 billion, the global  economy experienced a great extension, motorization proceeded and urban areas  expanded drastically, leading to widespread habitat loss. This stating only a few aspects of this era characterized  by expansion, innovation and discovery.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>                                           Humans have shaped and affected the marine  ecosystem and thereby marine life, rising more and more with human development. For example about 8% of  the primary production of the oceans is used by humans, while that fraction  grows to more than 25% in certain areas and for the temperate continental shelf systems to  more than one third. Furthermore, by 1995 one fifth of known marine fisheries  were overexploited or already exhausted and 44% were at a critical threshold.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vitousek_1997}</cite> This shows the great interference of humankind with the marine ecosystem,  especially marine life.</div><div>    Since 2015, we  have entered the third stage of the Anthropocene, named 'Stewards of the Earth  System'.  Given by the name of this era, now-a-days humans are seen as major geological  force, &nbsp;shaping the future of the earth system. This stage is described by growing  awareness, due to more research, global information-flow, more stable and democratic  governments, integration into policies concerns and social and cultural  concerns.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Steffen_2007}</cite></div><div>    Our current  extraction-consumption based economic&nbsp;model has led to rapid expansion of human  habitation and resource extraction causing detrimental effects on the extent  and integrity of the ecosystems and habitats that enable rich biodiversity and  vital ecosystem services. Furthermore, the resources we extract are often  returned to the environment in such a composition or context that they become  pollutants, which no longer cycle through the systems in an equilibrium or a  beneficial way. Going forward, human activity is likely to cause widespread  mass-extinctions and biodiversity loss with adverse consequences for future  habitability on earth, should we stay on a business as usual course without  altering our ways. Referring to the article “The future of biodiversity”,  currently the Earth is in its sixth great extinction event, with rates of  species loss growing rapidly for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pimm_1995,Ceballos2015}</cite>. The atmospheric concentrations of several important greenhouse gases have  increased substantially. As a result the Earth is warming rapidly&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2014}</cite> and more nitrogen is now  converted from the atmosphere into reactive forms by fertilizer production and  fossil fuel combustion compared to all of the natural processes in terrestrial  ecosystems put together.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Galloway_2002}</cite></div><div>    Most of the human-induced  stress on marine ecosystems can be ascribed to climate change.

Furthermore, he emphasizes marine  ecosystems in this era while describing ocean change as an ongoing process in  the whole history of earth and that the present ocean change be unique in the  modern time. It be the fastest change and perhaps the biggest influence, that a  single species ever had and that species be modern humans – us.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{riebesell2017}</cite></div><div>                                            For this  reason there is a need to understand the ongoing processes of ocean change and  the changes in marine ecosystems and their health.</div><div>         &nbsp;</div><div><b>Defining Marine Ecosystem Health</b></div><h3 data-label="340009" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The Importance of Understanding Marine Ecosystem Health and their Structure</h3><div> The marine ecosystem is an important biological system that provides services to humanity as a whole and therefore we  are a&nbsp;beneficiary of the ocean for what it provides, but research  is stressing the urgency for environmental management of this ecosystem due to  the rapidness of its declining state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp; </div><h3>Facing the Challenges of Defining Marine Ecosystem Health</h3><div>Suggested is an application of a human health metaphor which can help us to  assess the dilemmas in which we will face when understanding ecosystem health; there are three fundamental issues which are proposed: recognizing the absence of objective criteria for assessing health indicators, recognizing when changes are actual or a false alarm, and the quest to find classifying indicators with attributes of being holistic, early warning or diagnostic. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><div>Above those issues, we  face a two-fold challenge of boosting ecosystem behaviour and multiple stressor knowledge and working on the development of an identification system of indicators while we deal with the anthropogenic stressors which impact the integrity of biological ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite> </div><h3>Proposing the state of a healthy ecosystem</h3><div>Having mentioned the importance of evaluating the ecosystem health, it is proper to give a definition of what a healthy ecosystem is.                                     The healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite></div><div> </div><div></div>
