<div>So all in all, the impact rating often rather goes together with other methods, such as modelling or indexes, to&nbsp;display the change of interest and provide sufficient results for the whole ecosystem in a scale or rating system, than being communicated as a single method.</div><h2 data-label="605589" class="ltx_title_subsection">Indexes </h2><div>Generally speaking, an index in the field of biology is a method to represent results in a simple and conceptual way. Especially in Ecology, indexes are used to describe the complex condition of a system or habitat in an informative manner. Often bioindicators are used as a tool to gather information and measurements, from which the index will be calculated. This implies that an index is based on relations or aggregations of these measurements. For instance the Shannon-Wiener Index is a mathematical index which describes community diversity depending  on abundance and frequency of species.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ellis2015}</cite></div><div>Probably the most common used index in the assessment of marine ecosystem health is the Ocean Health Index. This index is a score from 1 to 100, indicating the state of the investigated marine ecosystem, whereby the score 1 expresses the worst condition and 100 implies an ideal healthy ecosystem, established on the concept of ecosystem health. The calculation of this number is based on ten goals, describing an ideal human-integrated marine system by dividing the score into different sub-sections. These departments include coastal protection, tourism and recreation, livelihoods, economies, iconic species, lasting special places, clean waters, habitats and species which describe  biodiversity, mariculture and fisheries, and artisanal fishing opportunity. The sub-sections have an individual score themselves and the conjunction of the goal score leads to the overall score. The Ocean Health Index  provides informations about regional marine sites as well as an annual  score of the global global ocean health.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2012}</cite></div><div> Indexes represent  scientific results in a simple, numerical way and thereby give a general  overview of the assessment results. This gives the method&nbsp;of indexes  the ability to display a rather complex investigation in a clear way.  Due to that indicators seem to be useful as a baseline which indicate a  focus and can be related to in further studies. At the same time this  simple approach can also be too facile or vacuous since it only gives a  number as outcome. Without looking at the evaluation how this number was  constructed or an explanation which are the causes for this outcome,  one might not understand the exact statement and validity of the index,  especially if it is a highly complex index. Therefore the  communicability, especially to laypeople, which represent the broader  audience, is decreasing in value or remains rather trivial. Combing the  index with a further method such as mapping could benefit the  communicability. Indexes being a mathematical construct of various  variables are fairly sensitive and reactive to changes, due to the fact  that a change of number of one variable directly effects the  calculation. However the effectiveness of the index remains dependent on  the individual index. The Ocean Health Index is a quite comprehensive index to  illustrate ocean health. But this broad spectrum of evaluation also  gives the possibility of lack of data, hence the measureability as well  as the sensitivity of the index declines.</div><div>  </div>
