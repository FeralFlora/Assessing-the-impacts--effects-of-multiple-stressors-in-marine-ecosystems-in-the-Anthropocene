<div>                                        Another example for making an online survey as expert  elicitation is a study of assessing 50 impacts and effects at the Laurentian  Great Lakes. The stressors were chosen by different criteria, such as the  potential to change the biology, chemistry and physical structure of the lakes,  their way of impact and the availability of information about the stressor. The  focus was on the stressor impact on the ecosystem itself, rather than human  health. As a result, the stressors were ranked by their impact or effects on  the ecosystem. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>    So one can see, that even if a specific method, such  as a survey, expert elicitation or scoring is generally used, it is often  combined with other method, such as mapping or modelling, to get the best  result.</div><h2 data-label="934305" class="ltx_title_subsection">         Novel concepts, improvements, conceptual frameworks and meta-methods</h2><h3 data-label="402276" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    <b>Conceptual frameworks</b>&nbsp;/ Meta-methods</h3><div>Tiered recommendations:</div><ul><li><b>2007:</b> A Phased Approach for Assessing Combined Effects from Multiple Stressors&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Menzie2007}</cite>  &nbsp;</li><li><b>2014:</b><i> Assessing the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota: The receptor's side matters&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></i></li><li><b>2016:<i>&nbsp;</i></b><i>New approaches to the ecological risk assessment of multiple stressors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></i></li><li><b>2017:&nbsp;</b><i>The challenges and opportunities in cumulative effects assessment&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley2017}</cite></i></li></ul><div></div><h3 data-label="488223" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Novel concepts and methods</h3><div>Concepts</div><div><b>Planetary Boundaries (</b><i>Planetary boundaries for a blue planet</i><b><i>)</i>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Nash2017}</cite></b></div><div></div><div>Methods</div><div>    <b>Novel probabilistic ERA framework <i>(</i></b><i>Integrated presentation of ecological risk from multiple stressors</i><b>)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Goussen2016}</cite></b></div><div><b>Novel regression approach, using non-linear parametric models   &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Welle2017}</cite></b></div><div><b>MARS (Managing Aquatic ecosystems andwater Resources undermultiple Stress) project</b></div><div><b>AOPs (Mechanistic toxicology)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hooper2013}</cite></b></div><div><b>Baseline condition of impact-sensitive indicator species   &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley2017}</cite></b></div><div>    </div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="427600" class="ltx_title_section">Results and discussion

More specifically, in some cases, dynamic processes such as oceanographic currents or immigration are fundamentally important and affect  the overall results, as it may      change how a stressor is distributed or spread its impacts among different locations&nbsp;<i><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Halpern_2009}</cite></i>. As regard the shifting baseline syndrome, it is not yet clear what baselines should the different methods use as&nbsp;a starting point. Relying exclusively on current data, ignoring the historical  references, may limit our understanding of the ecosystem fuctioning and increase the possibilty of a sudden&nbsp;collapse of the ecosystem services&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dearing_2012}</cite>.</div><div>Furthermore, we believe that a sufficient assessment method should be capable of recognizing whether the interactions between the multiple stressors are synergistic, additive or antagonistic. Having presented the meaning and function of these interactions in the<i>&nbsp;<b>Theory part()</b></i>, it is crucial to include them in the assessement methods, in order to predict more efficiently possible non-linear effects of the multiple stressors and be able to take the correct management decisions in the right time.</div><div><b>Applicability of the  methods</b></div><div>To address the applicability of the various multiple stressor assessment methods at different trophic and ecological organisational levels, it is necessary to comment on the potential applicability of these methods. As we've framed the focus of our project at the ecosystem level, the methods we are interested in should facilitate assessment of cumulative impacts at this level, rather than only provide insights into population or community level impacts and changes. But what exactly is understood by impacts assessments at an ecosystem level, and are such assessments within scientific reach? To assess ecosystem level impacts, it may well be necessary to approach the assessment with a tiered strategy that ends at an ecosystem assessment, but is conducted through stepwise considerations of specific ecosystem components, so  although a specific methodology isn't an ecosystem level impact assessment in and of itself, it may yet be an integral part of the big picture. These questions and considerations will now be addressed.</div><div>As exhaustively explained, the impacts on a specific species' population infer potential impacts on the community it is part of, which then infers potential impacts upon the functioning, structure and stability of the ecosystem the community is part of. Simultaneously, impacts on ecosystem functioning and environmental conditions infer potential impacts on the communities within the ecosystem and the populations that comprise these communities. Although explained by order of complexity, these perturbations may follow more chaotic or unpredictable impact pathways, and may occur in several directions at the same time. Thus, a multifaceted insight into the relationships, dynamics, processes and impact pathways between these various organisational levels and ecosystem components is necessary. The main question, then, is whether or not any particular assessment approach is sufficiently developed to account for the multitude of variables and insights to account for in order to predict or describe multiple stressor outcomes&nbsp; - without ignoring the complexities of stressor interactions, dynamic processes and non-linear responses. If not, which might be likely, the best current multiple stressor impact assessment at the ecosystem level might be a toolbox of select tools for specific sub-assessments, which, when properly combined, provide an ecosystem level overview of the impacts of multiple stressors.</div><div>For ecosystem level assessments to be viable and valuable (informative and predictive or early-warning), the applied methods must be able to reflect conditions and changes at this level. That is, they must strike the aforementioned balance between pragmatic practicality and sufficient accuracy and sophistication in the sense of an optimal limitation of uncertainties from misrepresentative assumptions.</div><div>For the use of indexes and indicators, these can be used either as a diagnostic or "indicative" aid, whereby the selected metrics provide insights to be analysed further, or, when deemed sufficiently representative of the state of the assessed ecosystem, as assessment methods by themselves. This latter approach can represent the "universal metric" approach, in contrast to modelling, for example. The applicability of indicators depends on their specific suitability for the ecosystem at hand and the ecological considerations and priorities which guide the management efforts related to the assessment.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja2009,Rombouts2013a}</cite></div><div>Our conclusion on this matter is that the ecosystem level approach is not only a scientific ideal, but is instead central to any understanding of the multiple stressor issue, since it is at this level that the surprising effects, which we want to understand so as to make them not be surprises anymore, arise.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halll}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Martinez-Crego2010}</cite></div><div><b>Applicability of models&nbsp;</b></div><div>Ecological risk assessment on the system scale: A review of state-of-the-art models and future perspectives</div><h2 data-label="205273" class="ltx_title_subsection">Missing steps</h2><div>-Abstract</div><div>-Methodology part</div><div>-Table with criteria</div><div>-Table with methodology (Ingmar)&nbsp;</div><div>-Conclusion</div><div></div>
