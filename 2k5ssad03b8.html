<div>                                        Another example for making an online survey as expert  elicitation is a study of assessing 50 impacts and effects at the Laurentian  Great Lakes. The stressors were chosen by different criteria, such as the  potential to change the biology, chemistry and physical structure of the lakes,  their way of impact and the availability of information about the stressor. The  focus was on the stressor impact on the ecosystem itself, rather than human  health. As a result, the stressors were ranked by their impact or effects on  the ecosystem. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>    So one can see, that even if a specific method, such  as a survey, expert elicitation or scoring is generally used, it is often  combined with other methods, such as mapping or modelling, to get the best  result.</div><h2 data-label="605589" class="ltx_title_subsection">Indexes </h2><div>Generally speaking, an index in the field of biology is a method to represent results in a simple and conceptual way. Especially in Ecology, indexes are used to describe the complex condition of a system or habitat in an informative manner. Often bioindicators are used as a tool to gather information and measurements, from which the index will be calculated. This implies that an index is based on relations or aggregations of these measurements. For instance the Shannon-Wiener Index is a mathematical index which describes community diversity depending  on abundance and frequency of species&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Ellis2015}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><div>Probably the most common used index in the assessment of marine ecosystem health is the Ocean Health Index. This index is a score from 1 to 100, indicating the state of the investigated marine ecosystem, whereby the score 1 expresses the worst condition and 100 implies an ideal healthy ecosystem, established on the concept of ecosystem health. The calculation of this number is based on ten goals, describing an ideal human-integrated marine system by dividing the score into different sub-sections. These departments include coastal protection, tourism and recreation, livelihoods, economies, iconic species, lasting special places, clean waters, habitats and species which describe  biodiversity, mariculture and fisheries, and artisanal fishing opportunity. The sub-sections have an individual score themselves and the conjunction of the goal score leads to the overall score. The Ocean Health Index  provides informations about regional marine sites as well as an annual  score of the global global ocean health&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halpern2012}</cite>.&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="934305" class="ltx_title_subsection">         Novel concepts, improvements, conceptual frameworks and meta-methods</h2><div>Other than the distinct methodological categories described above, our literature review also identified sets of recommended step, assembled into tiered or phased approaches to multiple stressor impact assessments. These recommendations were most often described in other literature reviews that provide an overview of the state of research in cumulative impact assessments, particularly in relation to the confounding nature of multiple stressor conditions. These approaches can also be described as meta-methods, because the steps incorporated into these tiered frameworks are in themselves methods as described above, so the result is a methodological construction which builds methodological components into a meta-method, which, through the structured assemblage of its component methods, aims to provide insights beyond the scope of single methods, each step building upon the other.</div><div>The aims of these tiered approaches are not only to provide a sound methodological assessment approach that can describe and possibly predict multiple stressor effects, but also to imbue the assessment process with clarity and direction with distinct steps or phases that provide overview and focus, both in the planning and execution of the assessment. This not only benefits those who conduct the research and assessment, but also the many stakeholders that are likely to be affected in a multiple stressor context.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Menzie2007}</cite></div><div>Beyond the tiered approaches, our literature review also encountered novel concepts that can be applied to provide insights into the cumulative impacts of human societies on the marine environment. One such concept of particular interest, namely the concept of&nbsp;<i>Planetary Boundaries -&nbsp;</i>when applied to the world ocean -, frames the issues of sustainability and human impacts at the very highest organisational level, the planetary scale. As such, this concept deals with the relationship between society and the biosphere as an expression of the large-scale ongoing biophysical changes in the Anthropocene, organised into nine categories:&nbsp;1.<b> &nbsp;</b>Stratospheric ozone depletion 2.&nbsp;Loss of biosphere integrity 3.&nbsp;Chemical pollution and the release of novel entities 4.&nbsp;Climate Change&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Ocean acidification 6.&nbsp;Freshwater use and the global hydrological cycle 7.&nbsp;Earth surface change&nbsp;8. Biogeochemical flows 9.&nbsp;Atmospheric aerosol loading.<b><b><b><b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></b></b></b></b>The biogeochemical factors included in the nine boundaries are key processes and components of the Earth system that regulate or influence the conditions of life on Earth. The boundaries for these processes are framed from a desire to limit deviation from Holocene conditions as they relate to current biosphere integrity, as these conditions are the only conditions under which civilization as we know it has existed. With the advent of the Anthropocene, the age of man which may ironically not be so conducive to human existence (let alone prosperity), humans are pushing these nine factors towards or beyond these boundaries, some of which are likely to exhibit threshold behavior<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Lenton2008}</cite>, which risks   generating abrupt or irreversible environmental changes. As an Earth system framework, the Planetary Boundaries can be understood as a pragmatic attempt at an assessment of humanity's global cumulative impacts and the risk these impacts impose on the integrity of the biosphere. But framing an assessment at this scale obviously has to negate or coarsely approximate the regional impacts that may arise from the intricacies of regional interaction of local stressors with global biogeochemical trends. The adaptation and refinement of the Planetary Boundary framework to account more accurately and holistically for the interactions between the individual boundaries and  dynamic ocean processes and changes has been adressed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Nash2017}</cite>, where they</div><h3 data-label="402276" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    <b>Conceptual frameworks</b>&nbsp;/ Meta-methods</h3><div>Tiered recommendations:</div><ul><li><b>2007:</b> A Phased Approach for Assessing Combined Effects from Multiple Stressors&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Menzie2007}</cite>  &nbsp;</li><li><b>2014:</b><i> Assessing the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota: The receptor's side matters&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Segner2014}</cite></i></li><li><b>2016:<i>&nbsp;</i></b><i>New approaches to the ecological risk assessment of multiple stressors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></i></li><li><b>2017:&nbsp;</b><i>The challenges and opportunities in cumulative effects assessment&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley2017}</cite></i></li></ul><h3 data-label="488223" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Novel concepts and methods</h3><div>Methods</div><div>    <b>Novel probabilistic ERA framework <i>(</i></b><i>Integrated presentation of ecological risk from multiple stressors</i><b>)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Goussen2016}</cite></b></div><div><b>Novel regression approach, using non-linear parametric models   &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Welle2017}</cite></b></div><div><b>MARS (Managing Aquatic ecosystems andwater Resources undermultiple Stress) project</b></div><div><b>AOPs (Mechanistic toxicology)&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hooper2013}</cite></b></div><div><b>Baseline condition of impact-sensitive indicator species   &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley2017}</cite></b></div><div>    </div><h1 data-label="692336" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><h2 data-label="297379" class="ltx_title_subsection">Summary of our findings: Different approaches to the multiple stressor issue</h2><div>Through the course of this literature review we identified the categorically different methodological approaches introduced and described above.

This finding is aligned with the complex and interdependent nature of marine ecosystems coupled with the diversity of impact pathways through the web of potentially non-additive and non-linear stressor interactions and impacts, as well as the multi-directional origin of effects, going not only from stressor to receptor, but arising instead from the multitude of interactions involved. This emphasizes the need to frame impacts not as intrinsic characteristics of stressors, but as emergent phenomenon that require an ecosystem based understanding. Thus, at the moment, there seems yet to be any single method which has unified and synthesized the necessary considerations and insights, although various approaches modelling are moving towards this&nbsp; which indicates the need for the derived finding that&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="281562" class="ltx_title_subsection">                                      </h2><div><table>   <tbody><tr>    <td>    <div><b>1</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Problem formulation and the purpose of the    assessment</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>What first needs to be done is to formulate the problem, what    includes setting the protection goals, the risk assessment objectives and    important ecological considerations.</div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div><b>2</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Define baseline</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Defining which are the reference points of interest is one of    the first steps that scientist should take.Setting clear historical baselines    is essential in examining degraded ecosystems to diminish the risk of    imprecise assumptions and provide a solid base for future comparisons. </div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div><b>3</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div><b>Conceptual model of ecosystem (focus on elements    and processes)</b></div>    <div><b>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    </b><b>identify bio-ecological receptors and    their relationships</b></div>    <div><b>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    </b><b>Relate the model to the concept of    ecosystem health</b></div>    </td>    <td>    <div>After finding the potential receptors, the ecosystem is    represented in a conceptual framework focusing on the receptors, their    interactions and the ecological processes.
