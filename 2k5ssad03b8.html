The stressors were chosen by different criteria, such as the  potential to change the biology, chemistry and physical structure of the lakes,  their way of impact and the availability of information about the stressor. The  focus was on the stressor impact on the ecosystem itself, rather than human  health. As a result, the stressors were ranked by their impact or effects on  the ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley_2017,Micheli_2013,Smith_2015}</cite></div>
