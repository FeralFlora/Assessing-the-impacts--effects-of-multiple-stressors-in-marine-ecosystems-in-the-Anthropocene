<div>                       Another example for making an online survey as expert  elicitation is a study of assessing 50 impacts and effects at the Laurentian  Great Lakes. The stressors were chosen by different criteria, such as the  potential to change the biology, chemistry and physical structure of the lakes,  their way of impact and the availability of information about the stressor. The  focus was on the stressor impact on the ecosystem itself, rather than human  health. As a result, the stressors were ranked by their impact or effects on  the ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Smith_2015}</cite></div><div>These methods are not always simple and cost-effective to collect, evaluate and rank, because you need a lot of data and expert opinions. Furthermore, expert elicitation has a high possibility of being biased or at least subject to uncertainty and a lack of replicability and transparency in the assessment process. Therefore, the comparability of the results, when applying the method&nbsp;to other locations and comparing to other studies, depends on the sufficiency of the data to give reliable information about the examined ecosystem, which is impaired by the aforementioned factors. This makes it difficult to provide early warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple stressors over time and to&nbsp;provide a future envision on possible interactions between the multiple stressors and ecosystem's degradation.</div>
