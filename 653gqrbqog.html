Discussion</h1><div>Throughout this literature review, we've examined the clashes between the need for an increase in ecological realism in cumulative impact and effects assessments, and the ongoing, systematic biogeochemical and environmental changes being brought about in the Anthropocene. As these changes take ecosystem farther away from the states in which they have been scientifically described and scrutinized, practical reductionistic assumptions underlying our understanding of the structure and coherence of ecological networks (and the anthropogenic stressors affecting them) leave our estimates of human impacts halting dangerously behind reality. The conundrum arising from the paradoxically opposed but simultaneous needs of scientific clarity and simplicity, to transparently guide policy and management, and ecological realism, to sufficiently reflect the complex interactivity of ecosystems under stress from multiple stressors, threatens to leave our conservation efforts tragically sundered from the necessary biosphere stewardship in the Anthropocene. This report set out to find contemporary assessment methods that have bridged this gap and allowed for an adequate balance between ecological realism and practical simplicity.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>We'll now discuss to which degree our recommended approach, with its basis in our literature review, aligns with these needs in the light of critical recommendations and considerations from other review articles and reports, and highlight the conditions that ensure the validity of the approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones_2016,Foley_2017,VanDenBrink2016,2017,Judd_2015}</cite></div><div></div><div>Furthermore, we will go into detail about the reasoning behind each step, as well as their relation to each other, and discuss the integrative opportunities of the combined methods, as well as describe some of the setbacks that the compromise of a tiered approach entails relative to an ideal, simple universal assessment method, yet achieved.</div><div></div><div>Our proposed tiered multiple stressor assessment approach aims to meet the criteria we judged the reviewed assessment approaches by. Specifically, we aimed for the approach to be transferable to a diverse range of marine ecosystems at various locations, spatially scalable to assess impacts with different extents to facilitate assessment focuses at different scales; the indicators and proxies used as representations of the ecological elements, processes and conditions that constitute marine ecosystem health, as defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Tett2013}</cite>, should be sufficiently simple and cost-effective to measure and evaluate, whilst being sensitive enough to enable early detection of change and impact, thus providing the assessment process with the ability to detect potential inter-stressor and cascading ecological effects and dynamic processes. Detection is an important first step, but responding effectively requires pairing the knowledge of an issue to an actionable understanding of it. The best case would therefore be if the information, the assessment approach produced, could provide (preferably ecological and mechanistic) insights, which avoid the assumptions of additivity and linearity, to enable predictive assessment capabilities. Finally, the assessment process should maintain transparency and toe the line of complexity in a balance that provides the aforementioned insights without alienating the public and other stakeholders for which the assessment is relevant, both environmentally and culturally. That is, the method should accommodate effective communication of the issues addressed through both the assessment process and results.</div><div></div><div>Some of the above criteria are met by generic nature of the assessment process we propose. As an assessment framework, the tiered approach embodies key aspects of ecological realism and scientific holism by incorporating these considerations into the structure of the assessment. We adapt&nbsp;the key point of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Segner2014}</cite>, framing stressor impacts from the receptor's perspective, by establishing the conceptual ecosystem model to identify key ecosystem elements, relationships and processes before identification and ranking the present stressors. The latter steps are then performed in relation to the former to anchor the assessment as ecosystem based&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Wrona1996}</cite>, cementing the cumulative nature of stressor impacts as a fundamental assessment principle&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sinclair2017}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Whilst some considerations are cooked into the tiered approach, its steps and their order, other critical considerations depend on the methods applied in each step. Because of the generalized nature of the assessment process, it also allows considerable malleability to accommodate transferability and scalability to diverse contexts and scale, since the methods appropriated to each step are chosen for their universal applicability, and if such universality cannot be achieved, one must rely on a diversity of regionally developed methods to bridge these gaps to any particular context. That is to say, as previously emphasized, that our recommended approach will not fit any context right "out-of-the-box", but can instead be adapted to most contexts to ensure that the embodied considerations are upheld through the structure of the assessment. Whilst this is valuable in itself, the results of the assessment process will ultimately depend on the ability of the appropriated methods to achieve the aims of each step. This is especially important for the ninth step of integration and quantification, which concludes the assessment. Therefore, we will now delve deeper into these methods, and especially the last step.</div><div></div><div>To formulate the problem  and address the assessment goal in a transparent and participatory way, there are a range of options with varying degrees of complexity, but one of the most important aspects of the planning and problem formulation stage is that the protection and sustainable management goals guide the following steps by establishing which receptors and assessment endpoint will be vital to measure directly or through appropriate bioindicators.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></div><div>It's important to note that the steps of the assessment do not necessarily conclude definitively as the process moves along, as each step requires considerations and decisions, and because knowledge gained throughout the assessment might warrant reconsideration of previous decisions (P45&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones2016}</cite>). Therefore, the problem formulation step may well extend into the conceptualization of the ecosystem to ensure a properly informed problem formulation and subsequent assessment focus. To bridge these steps, fuzzy cognitive mapping may be applied to facilitate the problem formulation process and guide constructive debate to reach a knowledge consensus about large ecosystems, and furthermore to inform early insights into how various management approaches might  fare, comparatively. By including a lot of stakeholders in this process, it helps build confidence in the assessment results.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hobbs2002}</cite></div><div></div><div>Defining a relevant and informative ecosystem health baseline to assess in relation to can be challenging, and even more so when assessing large marine ecosystems and open ocean ecosystems, for which sufficient baseline information might not be readily available. Often, meta-analytic  baseline studies are required to assemble and unify information from diverse sources across various custodians and data types, going from the previously fragmented state to usable data. One method to assemble such information was developed by the Health Ecological and Economic Dimensions of Global Change (HEED) Program's Multiple Marine Ecological Disturbance (MMED) project. The MMED methodology enables review studies that consolidate information about ecosystem disturbances and perturbations from bibliographic reference collections     through&nbsp;meta-data proxies&nbsp; aiming to catch all observational records of various kinds, to compensate for lacking organized direct field observations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sherman2000,Sherman2017}</cite>.

Nonetheless, numerical methods for quantifying, assessing, modelling, and predicting cumulative effects are well described.

are relatively well described, but the required monitoring data are generally lacking (Dammanet al. 1995; Scherer 2011; Schultz 2012; Ball et al. 2013; Venier et al. 2014), and are “expensive and time consuming to gather” (Connelly 2011). Obviously, more complex models call for more complex input datasets and underlying monitoring programs, so a vicious cycle is apparent (Gallagher et al. 2015). The information that is available is “highly uncertain and variable in quality” (Karkkainen 2002), and is, for the most part, not efficiently shared among CEA participants (Damman et al. 1995).</i></li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="713045" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Challenges </h2><div>Assessing the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in marine ecosystems itself is one of the biggest challenges in science.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite>&nbsp;But why is this assessment that challenging?&nbsp;Trying to make a&nbsp;holistic or ecosystem-based perspective is one of the key challenges in stress ecology and ocean management today and especially as the Anthropocene progresses. This is due to the complexity of the topic and a huge lack of data, such as the still only partly understood interactions among multiple stressors in marine ecosystems. Therefore, considerable future reseacrh is needed to&nbsp;improve the contribution these system models make to understand interactions among multiple stressors.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></div><div>Fundamental questions in this research section are, whether the&nbsp;expected joint effect of a cumulative impact and effect is higher or lower than the intensity of each single stressor. Moreover,&nbsp;it is critical to assess whether the various stressors are overlapping in time and space to result in a potential cumulative effect.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite>&nbsp;Therefore, marine stressors can be grouped into stressors acting  globally and those that  act at in a local to regional level but occur globally.&nbsp;<a href="#Porter1999"><i>(Porter  et al., 1999)</i></a>&nbsp;Additionally, the recovery potential of an ecosystem might be important to differenciate between multi- and univariate stressors' impacts. Another question is whether the cumulative effect of multivariate stressors just quantitatively differ from the effect of single stressors or if there are new effects and responses, which differ from the expected or predicted outcome.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite>&nbsp;This problem is shown by categorizing the different stressors and their interactions into synergistic, antagonistic and additive effects.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite> These considered interactions and decisions about the necessary input data, the running of the model and the description of the final uncertainty in the model influence the expected size, such as magnitude, extent and intensity of the stressors caused by the given combination of stressors.&nbsp;Another problem in relation to the aforementioned balancing act between accuracy and practicality is the lack of consistency or standardization in approaches, definitions and vocabulary of cumulative impacts assessment. This lack of clarity leads to a recommendation of looking critical on defining the scope of the assessment and the best fitting methodologies. As one can see before, the recommended steps of assessing multiple stressors are a mixture of different methods, collecting the best fitting methodologies. Although there still exist various definitions of how to describe cumulative impact assessment, one can say, that all cumulative effect assessments are based on an ecosystem approach.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite>&nbsp;This need for the development of an ecosystem based approach to the assessment of cumulative impacts from multiple stressors has been recognized and emphasized for decades&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Wrona1996}</cite>. Therefore, it is important to get an&nbsp;integrated knowledge of ecosystem structure and function, a&nbsp;holistic overview of the interacting stressors at different organizational, spatial and temporal scales within the ecosystem and to develop management strategies that are ecological, anticipatory and ethical.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Christie_1986,Judd_2015,Wrona1996}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>So cumulative effects assessments involve assessing and evaluating the interactions between multiple stressors with multiple effects on multiple ecosystem components. This complex web of interactions of direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors quickly generates a complicated and unwieldy network of multiple interactions. How to manage and assess this complexity is a challenge to all forms of cumulative effects assessment. The assessment of multiple stressors and their impacts and effects is&nbsp;clearly impractical. Therefore the application of environmental risk assessment principles allows  a meaningful and achievable assessment for multiple stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Judd_2015}</cite> Environmental risk assessment is a process of choice, based on identifying the likely consequences of different oeffects and impacts and selecting the best actions &nbsp;to minimising and managing environmental risks.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{University2011}</cite></div><h2 data-label="593218" class="ltx_title_subsection"> 	Case study: Exploration of hypothetical assessment of the Great Barrier Reef</h2><div>    By applying our proposed steps explained in the results,  we'll make and explore a hypothetical  assessment of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), using articles previously analyzed during our research process to give practical examples, whenever possible, on how each step can be executed and its goal achieved.   &nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="686126" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">1.
