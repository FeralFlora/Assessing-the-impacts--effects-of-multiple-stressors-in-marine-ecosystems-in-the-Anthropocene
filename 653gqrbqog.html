But before concluding our results, we have a final, possibly novel, idea of our own to present, which is proposed in extension of the adverse outcome pathway method discussed and highlighted for step nine.</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea, based on AOPs and&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hooper2013}</cite>, is as follows:</div><ul><li>Make a large, collaborative database of various impact pathways, each described in a unified way.</li><li>Then, incorporate this database into software that can assemble complex AOPs, integrating the impacts into a prediction of the outcome of the population in question.</li><li>The results might not always be accurate, but they can give a quick inclination of the possible outcomes</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div>Throughout this literature review, we've examined the clashes between the need for an increase in ecological realism in cumulative impact and effects assessments, and the ongoing, systematic biogeochemical and environmental changes being brought about in the Anthropocene. As these changes take ecosystem farther away from the states in which they have been scientifically described and scrutinized, practical reductionistic assumptions underlying our understanding of the structure and coherence of ecological networks (and the anthropogenic stressors affecting them) leave our estimates of human impacts halting dangerously behind reality. The conundrum arising from the paradoxically opposed but simultaneous needs of scientific clarity and simplicity, to transparently guide policy and management, and ecological realism, to sufficiently reflect the complex interactivity of ecosystems under stress from multiple stressors, threatens to leave our conservation efforts tragically sundered from the necessary biosphere stewardship in the Anthropocene. This report set out to find contemporary assessment methods that have bridged this gap and allowed for an adequate balance between ecological realism and practical simplicity.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>We'll now discuss to which degree our recommended approach, with its basis in our literature review, aligns with these needs in the light of critical recommendations and considerations from other review articles and reports, and highlight the conditions that ensure the validity of the approach&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones_2016,Foley_2017,VanDenBrink2016,2017,Judd_2015}</cite> byt into detail about the reasoning behind each step, as well as their relation to each other, and discuss the integrative opportunities of the combined methods, as well as describe some of the setbacks that the compromise of a tiered approach entails relative to an ideal, simple universal assessment method, yet achieved.</div><div></div><div>Our proposed tiered multiple stressor assessment approach aims to meet the criteria we judged the reviewed assessment approaches by. Specifically, we aimed for the approach to be transferable to a diverse range of marine ecosystems at various locations, spatially scalable to assess impacts with different extents to facilitate assessment focuses at different scales; the indicators and proxies used as representations of the ecological elements, processes and conditions that constitute marine ecosystem health, as defined by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Tett2013}</cite>, should be sufficiently simple and cost-effective to measure and evaluate, whilst being sensitive enough to enable early detection of change and impact, thus providing the assessment process with the ability to detect potential inter-stressor and cascading ecological effects and dynamic processes. Detection is an important first step, but responding effectively requires pairing the knowledge of an issue to an actionable understanding of it. The best case would therefore be if the information, the assessment approach produced, could provide (preferably ecological and mechanistic) insights, which avoid the assumptions of additivity and linearity, to enable predictive assessment capabilities. Finally, the assessment process should maintain transparency and toe the line of complexity in a balance that provides the aforementioned insights without alienating the public and other stakeholders for which the assessment is relevant, both environmentally and culturally. That is, the method should accommodate effective communication of the issues addressed through both the assessment process and results.</div><div></div><div>Some of the above criteria are met by generic nature of the assessment process we propose. As an assessment framework, the tiered approach embodies key aspects of ecological realism and scientific holism by incorporating these considerations into the structure of the assessment. We adapt&nbsp;the key point of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Segner2014}</cite>, framing stressor impacts from the receptor's perspective, by establishing the conceptual ecosystem model to identify key ecosystem elements, relationships and processes before identification and ranking the present stressors. The latter steps are then performed in relation to the former to anchor the assessment as ecosystem based&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Wrona1996}</cite>, cementing the cumulative nature of stressor impacts as a fundamental assessment principle&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sinclair2017}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Whilst some considerations are cooked into the tiered approach, its steps and their order, other critical considerations depend on the methods applied in each step. Because of the generalized nature of the assessment process, it also allows considerable malleability to accommodate transferability and scalability to diverse contexts and scale, since the methods appropriated to each step are chosen for their universal applicability, and if such universality cannot be achieved, one must rely on a diversity of regionally developed methods to bridge these gaps to any particular context. That is to say, as previously emphasized, that our recommended approach will not fit any context right "out-of-the-box", but can instead be adapted to most contexts to ensure that the embodied considerations are upheld through the structure of the assessment. Whilst this is valuable in itself, the results of the assessment process will ultimately depend on the ability of the appropriated methods to achieve the aims of each step. This is especially important for the ninth step of integration and quantification, which concludes the assessment. Therefore, we will now delve deeper into these methods, and especially the last step.</div><div></div><div>To formulate the problem  and address the assessment goal in a transparent and participatory way, there are a range of options with varying degrees of complexity, but one of the most important aspects of the planning and problem formulation stage is that the protection and sustainable management goals guide the following steps by establishing which receptors and assessment endpoint will be vital to measure directly or through appropriate bioindicators.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{VanDenBrink2016}</cite></div><div>It's important to note that the steps of the assessment do not necessarily conclude definitively as the process moves along, as each step requires considerations and decisions, and because knowledge gained throughout the assessment might warrant reconsideration of previous decisions (P45&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jones2016}</cite>). Therefore, the problem formulation step may well extend into the conceptualization of the ecosystem to ensure a properly informed problem formulation and subsequent assessment focus. To bridge these steps, fuzzy cognitive mapping may be applied to facilitate the problem formulation process and guide constructive debate to reach a knowledge consensus about large ecosystems, and furthermore to inform early insights into how various management approaches might  fare, comparatively. By including a lot of stakeholders in this process, it helps build confidence in the assessment results.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hobbs2002}</cite></div><div></div><div>Defining a relevant and informative ecosystem health baseline to assess in relation to can be challenging, and even more so when assessing large marine ecosystems and open ocean ecosystems, for which sufficient baseline information might not be readily available. Often, meta-analytic  baseline studies are required to assemble and unify information from diverse sources across various custodians and data types, going from the previously fragmented state to usable data. One method to assemble such information was developed by the Health Ecological and Economic Dimensions of Global Change (HEED) Program's Multiple Marine Ecological Disturbance (MMED) project. The MMED methodology enables review studies that consolidate information about ecosystem disturbances and perturbations from data-mining of bibliographic reference collections     through&nbsp;meta-data (1.&nbsp;<i>what</i> happened, 2.&nbsp;<i>where</i> (longitude and latitude), 3. involving&nbsp;<i>which</i> species, 4. with what associated co-occurring factors. Also noting citation source and source quality ranking), aiming to catch all observational records of various kinds, to compensate for lacking organized direct field observations&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sherman2000,Sherman2017}</cite>. The usefulness of this approach extends into step 4, where the present drivers and stressors are identified, since the insights produced don't just set an assessment baseline, but also inform of the frequency and amplitude of various regional disturbance events over time, categorized into eight  disturbance types, namely 1. Biotoxin/exposure     events, 2. Anoxia/hypoxia events, 3. Trophic magnification events, 4. Mass mortality     events, 5. Physical forcing     events, 6.&nbsp;Disease     events, 7.&nbsp;Novel and invasive events 8.&nbsp;Keystone, chronic, and dramatic events.</div><div></div><div>Although we argue in favor of an historical baseline for multiple stressor assessments, not to return to a pristine past, but to give an honest representation of our impacts, there are those who argue that such historical baselines are increasingly irrelevant and inappropriate for conserving and managing human-dominated ecosystems, since humans have changed these systems into&nbsp;novel ecosystems that have no natural analog.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Kopf2015}</cite>&nbsp;argue that since the onset of the industrial era and the related rise of human impacts and anthropogenic modification of the biosphere, there are virtually no examples left of ecosystems that can be assumed to be in a state representative of conditions in absence of human disturbance. And so, there is a lack of suitable contemporary least disturbed reference points that are representative of ecosystem functioning without human interference. Still, contemporary baselines are still conducive to shifting baseline syndrome and may lead to unambitious and misguided restoration goals&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jackson2001,Jackson2011}</cite>, whilst increasing the risk of unexpected collapse of ecosystem services&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dearing2012}</cite>. Thus, Kopt et al. argue in favor of a new pragmatic type of baseline called anthropocene baselines for certain ecosystems. This approach acknowledges that returning to historical states may be impossible or unrealistically difficult to return to, since recovery can't match the trajectory of decline,&nbsp;for two reasons in particular: (1)&nbsp;    socioeconomic     limitations on reducing anthropogenic pressure (2)   limitations by     ecological constraints. In the former case, human habitation may be dependent on the modified ecosystem state so as to make restoration practically but not principally impossible (e.g. the Aral Sea), whilst in the latter case, the modifications may be so extreme that reversal is impossible, either because critical abiotic or biotic remnants of the former state are gone (e.g. keystone species extinction), or because catastrophic non-linear thresholds have otherwise caused a state shift (see figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{578439}</span>) Therefore, the best management and restoration outcomes in such cases may be these dynamic anthropogenic baselines, which mark the rehabilitation potential of human-dominated ecosystems in the Anthropocene. For such a baseline to be necessary, the ecosystem must be assessed to be in a state outside of what can be restored to the historical baseline of ecological variability. This approach can be seen as salvaging what can be saved in a situation where all cannot be, and thus marks a pragmatic realization that whatever the conceivable future holds is contained within the conditions of Anthropocene, the ultimate limiting factor. The greatest strength of this realization is that it can defend against overly optimistic management expectations that could otherwise justify unsustainable resource use, in contrast to the limitations imposed by the level of change in the Anthropocene. Conversely, the concept of anthropocene baselines may also be abused for short-term gain by promoting an opportunistically fatalistic approach to baseline assessments with perilous consequences for biodiversity.</div><div></div><div></div>
