<div>&nbsp;<b>2. Baseline</b></div><div>Having described the nature of the problem, the assessment goals and intended outcomes, the next step would be to define a distinct baseline against which to assess the current status of the Great Barrier reef. In light of recent findings that indicate that contemporary coral baselines might grossly underestimate the decline of coral cover since pre-Anthropocene times&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{McClenachan2017}</cite>, we recommend a historical baseline whenever possible to counter the shifting baseline syndrome. This ideal is, of course, limited by the availability of reliable data or proxies for coral cover, and the uncertainties involved when extrapolating information form sources that preceded the rigorous observational practices of the scienfi</div><div>The invention of the diving equipment and technique was an important step and tool for the exploration of the underwater world and thus coral reefs. However, this progress happended just the last 50 years and as a result there are not many quantitative studies  for assessing the reefs before the intensification of Anthropocene&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jackson_2001}</cite>   . It is notable that even in the early 1960s (first diving-exploration attempts), coral reefs have already been degraded   &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wilkinson}</cite>. Furthermore, a recent research which treat results of extent surveys suggest that a decline from 28.0% to 13.8% has happended in the cover of  corals in GBR during the last 27 years&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{De_ath_2012}</cite>. Consequently, before starting the assessment procedure, it is vital to look in historical references about all the different factors and elements that are going to be examined in order to prevent misleading assumptions. A useful tool for this is the "REEF" database, which has been developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in association with CSIRO. It provides  scientists with all the published and  unpublished material available, in relation to the GBR  dating back to the 19th century. Furthermore, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) conducts   long-term monitoring programs, combining natural historical records of the points of interest in GBR, such as coral cover and weather patterns, with advanced technologies(satellite-based mapping and remote sensing techniques). This programs help scientists understand and visualize  GBR's state in a holistic approach.&nbsp;</div>
