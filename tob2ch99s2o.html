<h3 data-label="537350" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">&nbsp;2. Baseline</h3><div>Having described the nature of the problem, the assessment goals and intended outcomes, the next step would be to define a distinct baseline against which to assess the current status of the Great Barrier reef. In light of recent findings that indicate that contemporary coral baselines might grossly underestimate the decline of coral cover since pre-Anthropocene times&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{McClenachan2017}</cite>, we recommend a historical baseline whenever possible to counter the shifting baseline syndrome. This ideal is, of course, limited by the availability of reliable data or proxies for coral cover, and the uncertainties involved when extrapolating information from sources that preceded the rigorous observational practices of the scientific method, and the technologies available today.</div><div>The invention of the diving equipment and technique was an important step and tool for the exploration of the underwater world and thus coral reefs. However, this progress happened within just the last 50 years and as a result there are not many quantitative studies  for assessing the reefs before the intensification of Anthropocene&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Jackson_2001}</cite>   . It is notable that even in the early 1960s (first diving-exploration attempts), coral reefs had already been degraded   &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Wilkinson}</cite>. A recent study, which analyses the results of extent surveys, suggests that a decline from 28.0% to 13.8% has happened in the cover of  corals in Great Barrier reef during the last 27 years&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{De_ath_2012}</cite>. Such percentages may be even higher, when compared to historical baselines, underlining the need to consider historical references about all the different factors and elements that are going to be examined in order to prevent misleading assumptions, before initiating the assessment procedure. In our assessment context, a useful tool for this is the&nbsp;<b>REEF</b> database, which has been developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in association with CSIRO. It provides  scientists with all the published and  unpublished material available, in relation to the Great Barrier reef, dating back to the 19th century. Furthermore, the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) conducts   long-term monitoring programs, combining natural historical records of the points of interest in Great Barrier reef, such as coral cover and weather patterns, with advanced technologies (satellite-based mapping and remote sensing techniques). This program can help scientists understand and visualize the Great Barrier reef's state in a holistic and historically considerate way.</div>
