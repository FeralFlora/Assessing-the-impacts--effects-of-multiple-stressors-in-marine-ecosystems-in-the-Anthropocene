This becomes useful when mapping and quantifying cumulative  impacts. The method was used by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Micheli_2013}</cite> , where 22 anthropogenic drivers  in 17 ecosystems were assembled into a spatial dataset to construct a  cumulative impact model. It was created in a 4-step process: 22 anthropogenic  drivers were given spatial datasets, the drivers are then scaled - allowing for  comparison, then cumulative impact scores are calculated, resulting in impact  weights, and finally created were categories for the cumulative impact scores  with thresholds in mind.</div><div>    So we are able to rank the different stressors by scoring their  impacts. This could help to find out, which the important stressors are and  which of them urgently need to be mitigated.</div><div>    Also  found as an method of impact rating was expert elicitation, in which selectively chosen  experts are given a survey in order to collect data for ranking stressors&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Smith_2015}</cite>&nbsp;or&nbsp;to analyse cumulative impacts&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley_2017}</cite>. Therefore defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance  are still&nbsp;a huge problem in assessing multiple stressors. To answer these problems, a survey with 33  multiple-choice and seven open-end questions was used to get more information  about how to assess multiple stressors interacting in ecosystems. The complexity  of their interactions is shown in Fig. 4. To assess these multiple stressors, the researchers recommend that it is needed to first define the word impact, then do  research about the relationships and connections between activities, stressors  and ecosystem effects. Last, the overlapping and eventually interacting effects  and impacts of multiple stressors should be mapped.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Foley_2017}</cite></div><div>            </div>
