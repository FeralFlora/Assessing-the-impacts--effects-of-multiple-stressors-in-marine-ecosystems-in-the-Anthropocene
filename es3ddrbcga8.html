These  assumptions, respectively, lead to some strengths and limitations that are  presented above.</div><div>    </div><div>The first advantage of this method is its ability to demonstrate its  results in a simple and visualized way. This fact makes these maps a useful  tool for many education programs and also it is east to communicate the extent  of the problem to the community. Furthermore, the proposed framework can easily  be used and applied to local and regional scale assessment efforts, using a  more solid and integrated database(B. S. Halpern et al., 2008). </div><div>    </div><div>One of the first assumptions that scientists make in this method, in order  to combine stressors with variable distributions and different measurement  units, is to transform and normalize them. Additionally, as scientists have not  yet completely understood when, where or why non-additive responses  (synergistic and antagonistic) occur (Crain et al. 2008, Darling and Cote 2008)  they consider that cumulative stressor impacts are additive. The drawback of these  decisions is that the examined habitats will respond linearly to possible  changes. It is almost undoubtful, however, that such linear responses of  ecosystems to multiple stressors are the exception rather than the rule and  this could lead to insufficient results(Benjamin S. Halpern &amp; Fujita, 2013). Lastly, cumulative  impact mapping can rarely take into account historical references, even though  they are crucial to understanding how an area is affected by the various human  impacts on it.</div><div>            {</div>
