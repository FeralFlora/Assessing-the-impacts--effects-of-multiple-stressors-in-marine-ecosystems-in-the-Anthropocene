<div>                                      </div><div>This method may seem simple, as it only needs to calculate the intensity of  each stressor, map the location of each habitat type and apply a vulnerability  weight (Halpern et al. 2007, Halpern et al. 2008b, Teck et al. 2010, Kappel et  al. 2012), but it requires to take into account many assumptions. These  assumptions, respectively, lead to some strengths and limitations that are  presented above.    </div><div>The first advantage of this method is its ability to demonstrate its  results in a simple and visualized way. This fact makes these maps a useful  tool for many education programs and also it is east to communicate the extent  of the problem to the community. Furthermore, the proposed framework can easily  be used and applied to local and regional scale assessment efforts, using a  more solid and integrated database(B. S. Halpern et al., 2008). </div><div>&nbsp;One of the first assumptions that scientists make in this method, in order  to combine stressors with variable distributions and different measurement  units, is to transform and normalize them. Additionally, as scientists have not  yet completely understood when, where or why non-additive responses  (synergistic and antagonistic) occur (Crain et al. 2008, Darling and Cote 2008)  they consider that cumulative stressor impacts are additive. The drawback of these  decisions is that the examined habitats will respond linearly to possible  changes. It is almost undoubtful, however, that such linear responses of  ecosystems to multiple stressors are the exception rather than the rule and  this could lead to insufficient results(Benjamin S. Halpern &amp; Fujita, 2013). Lastly, cumulative  impact mapping can rarely take into account historical references, even though  they are crucial to understanding how an area is affected by the various human  impacts on it.</div><h2 data-label="863297" class="ltx_title_subsection">Impact Rating</h2><div>                                                 &nbsp;Looking at the category of impact rating, one can find different  methods, such as scoring which is also used in connection with meta-analysis  and modelling. This becomes useful when mapping and quantifying cumulative  impacts. The method was used by (Micheli <i>et al.</i>,  2013), where 22 anthropogenic drivers  in 17 ecosystems were assembled into a spatial dataset to construct a  cumulative impact model. It was created in a 4-step process: 22 anthropogenic  drivers were given spatial datasets, the drivers are then scaled - allowing for  comparison, then cumulative impact scores are calculated, resulting in impact  weights, and finally created were categories for the cumulative impact scores  with thresholds in mind.</div><div>    So we are able to rank the different stressors by scoring their  impacts. This could help to find out, which the important stressors are and  which of them urgently need to be mitigated.</div><div>    Also  found as an method of impact rating was expert elicitation, in which selectively chosen  experts are given a survey in order to collect data for ranking stressors (Smith, 2014a) or&nbsp;to analyse cumulative impacts (Foley <i>et al.</i>, 2017). Therefore defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance  are still&nbsp;a huge problem in assessing multiple stressors. To answer these problems, a survey with 33  multiple-choice and seven open-end questions was used to get more information  about how to assess multiple stressors interacting in ecosystems. The complexity  of their interactions is shown in <b>Fig</b>.  . To assess these multiple stressors, the researchers recommend, that for assessing  multiple stressors it is needed to first define the word impact, then do  research about the relationships and connections between activities, stressors  and ecosystem effects. Last, the overlapping and eventually interacting effects  and impacts of multiple stressors should be mapped. (Foley, 2017)</div><div>            </div>
