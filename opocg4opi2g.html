Underlying of Ecosystem health is the idea, that ecosystems have an optimal, healthy and natural state, which is urged to protect and retain. But what means healthy in this context and what kind of properties has a marine ecosystem to display to be classified as healthy? Marine Ecosytem health is difficult to define, because as an open system, it is in a constant flux and exchange with its surrounding. Furthermore there are different perceptions of the elements which belong to a marine ecosystem. Generally it can be said that a marine ecoystems consists of the abiotic environment and the biotic community but its argued if this includes humans as a property of this constuct as well. Based on this, marine ecosystem health is not seen as a single feature, but as the sum of contributions of the biotic community, meaning individuals and populations and the abiotic processes within the system.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>A healthy ecosystem is characterized as one  that is          capable of maintaining its vigor (overall metabolism and energy flow) and organization (diversity of interactions between ecosystem components) over time, in the presence of a stress (resilience). Focusing on the ecosystem resilience, it has two main components, the length of time (RT) that a system needs to recover from stress and the magnitude of stress (Ms), from which the system can return to its former state.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Costanza1999}</cite>&nbsp;These factors are important because ecosystems show little change under a stress until they reach a critical threshold, related to RT and Ms. After this point, they react in highly unpredictable (non-linear) ways and this may lead to their collapse.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Scheffer2015}</cite> &nbsp;</div><div>As  it is beneficial to understand where an ecosystem was prior to  stressors, there are common symptoms in which signal ecosystem  degradation; they have been identified from reoccurring stressor impacts  and described with the ecosystem distress syndrome concept.</div><div>Degradative symptoms characterise many ecosystems that are experiencing multiple stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Rapport_1992}</cite>  claims that aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome can include some or  most of the symptoms listed: alteration in biotic community structure to  favor smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by  'r' selected species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened  food-chain length, increased disease prevalence, and reduced population  stability.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite> </div><div>To assess the dilemmas which are faced when understanding&nbsp; ecosystem health the application of a human health metaphor is suggested. There are three fundamental issues which are proposed: recognizing the absence of objective criteria for assessing health indicators, recognizing when changes are actual or a false alarm, and the quest to find classifying indicators with attributes of being holistic, early warning or diagnostic.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><div>Above those issues, we  face a two-fold challenge of boosting ecosystem behaviour and multiple stressor knowledge and working on the development of an identification system of indicators while we deal with the anthropogenic stressors which impact the integrity of biological ecosystems.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992a}</cite></div><h3>       Ecosystem Indicators</h3><div>Scientists’  interest in choosing appropriate indicators for evaluating the  ecosystem health has grown over the last two decades and nowadays  ecological indicators are used widely to communicate information about  ecosystems and the impact human activity has on them. Indicators are  usually used to track negative change or degradation of an ecosystem.  They often demonstrate damage that has already occurred and provide  little information about future degradation.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>For  better results and precise outcomes in the evaluation process,  indicators must be carefully selected, in order to represent ­­­the  various aspects of an ecosystem. Any indicator should be sensitive  enough to provide an early warning of change,&nbsp;be able to detect changes  over a wide geographical area and capable of providing a continuous  assessment over many different  stressors. Furthermore, an indicator  should be relatively independent of sample size, easy and cost-effective  to measure, collect and calculate and able to understand the  differences between the natural cycles or trends and the human  induced  stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3>Biomarkers</h3><div>Thermal  stress is one indicator in the present height of research and concern.  As anthropogenic activity increases the temperature of the ocean, many  marine communities show signs of stress as an effect of the ocean  absorbing carbon dioxide. Evaluating certain aspects of the ocean can  help us understand, predict, and hopefully slow down the impacts imposed  by human existence. But how can we start evaluation of stress?  Researchers look for biomarkers which can indicate &nbsp;environmental  change.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sammarco2013}</cite></div><div>Physical  appearance is a possible key biomarker, a quantifiable characteristic  in which can be measured and  can help identify a biological process,&nbsp;  of stressor impacts on coral reefs as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Cooper2009}</cite>  point out a prime example of this in the symbiotic relationship between  corals and microalgae, and the joint pigmentation they produce. Within  coral live photosynthetic dinoflagellate, a type of microscopic algae.  The two organisms live in symbiosis; the coral providing accommodation,  carbon dioxide, and nutrients while the algae supply molecular oxygen  produced by photosynthesis and also fixed carbon which aids in the  coral’s energy requirements.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sammarco2013,Solayan2016,corals}</cite>  Brightness in corals is a direct effect of the corals having  light-absorbing compounds that result in pigmentation but they are aided  by the pigments found in their symbiont photosynthetic microscopic  organisms.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>  Measuring this pigmentation is a potential assessment tool in assessing  water quality and furthermore, the overall health of the ecosystem.  Water quality is defined as a change in its chemistry, including changes  in the concentration of the amount of nutrients, rates of sedimentation  and levels of turbidity’. Considering that the symbiotic pair is  sensitive to water quality shifting, any changes will directly affect  the microorganisms in the possible changes described before. Therefore,  by measuring the pigmentation of both coral and the microscopic algae,  one can gain an understanding of the surrounding water quality.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>.</div><div>Another  efficient tool for scientists who want to evaluate the health of an  ecosystem is the use of empirical estimated indicators, which are  categorized into primary producers and primary consumers.</div><h3><b>Trophic level indicators</b></h3><div>   Organisms are organized in  different&nbsp;trophic levels according  to their feeding relationships.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Trites2001}</cite>  The energy in the  ocean is transferred by photoautotrophic organisms,  or&nbsp;primary producers, placed in the first trophic level to  herbivores,  or&nbsp;primary consumers, that  form the second trophic level. They are  followed by the carnivores, also called&nbsp;secondary and tertiary  consumers,  that occupy the third and last trophic level. In addition,  there is a group  called&nbsp;decomposers, existing on  waste and dead  remains, that breakdown all the organic matter.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sumich2016}</cite>   All of them form a&nbsp;food web in which all the organisms  rely on the  organic matter produced by primary producers. In the ocean, the   principal primary producers are phytoplankton, zooplankton are the  primary  consumers and the rest are secondary and tertiary consumers.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Gaedke2009}</cite> </div><div>Trophic   cascade is defined by Herendeen&nbsp;as the change in the  stock of one  trophic level when the stock of another trophic level is changed.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Herendeen2004}</cite>   They are the consequences of a higher trophic level on their following one.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Pace2013}</cite>  Even though this  last case is the most common, infectious agents can also produce a trophic  cascade.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Buck2017}</cite></div><div>Moreover,  trophic interactions are defined  as relationships between different  organisms residing in the same area. These  interactions are&nbsp;symbiotic  if at  least one of the involved species is benefited. They can be  classified in three  subgroups:&nbsp;mutualism-benefits to  both, symbiont  and host, parasitism-provides benefit to the symbiont to expense of the  host<b>,&nbsp;</b>and in&nbsp;commensalism  the symbiont benefits from the host without causing any effect on it.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sumich2016}</cite></div><div>Trophic levels in marine ecosystem can be used as indicators to provide information of the health condition. Distinction has been made between single and multiple trophic levels indicators, as described in the following paragraph.</div><h3>                                   Single trophic level indicators</h3><div>           Primary producers are indicators which consist of the  phytoplankton and the phytobenthic groups. Tracking phytoplankton’s fast  growth rates and response to low levels pollutants, scientists can  identify sensitive and early signs­­ of ecological changes and  environmental disturbance in marine surface waters.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{PAERL_2003}</cite>&nbsp;Phytobenthic  groups are sensitive indicators of changes in marine environments as  they  live long and they usually are sessile organisms.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,VanHoey2010}</cite>&nbsp;Macrobenthic  communities also undergo chronic disturbances which affect their  diversity, total abundance and total biomass and this may help the  scientists identify modifications in the trophic structure and  functioning of an ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,Dauvin_2007,Warwick_1994,article}</cite></div><div>Primary  consumer indicators include the zooplankton and zoobenthic groups. In  2005, the professor Weijerman mentioned that the abundance of  zooplankton species can be used to document sudden ecosystem shifts in  different regions of the world and also help identify the effects of  global warming and its consequences on regional hydrodynamics. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Beaugrand2009}</cite>&nbsp;As  regard to zoobenthic groups, their structural characteristics can be  useful to monitor the impacts of environmental stress in coastal systems  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007}</cite>&nbsp;and they can also be used in detecting early environmental disturbances, especially in estuarine habitats.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007,Elliott2007}</cite></div><h3>Two or more trophic level indicators</h3><div>The  restriction of using these empirical estimated indicators, however, is  that they can demonstrate the state of an ecosystem examining only a  single trophic level. The need for assessing the ecosystem health in two  or more trophic levels led scientists to introduce different  approaches. </div><div>The use of <b>stable isotope profiles</b> as  environmental and trophic indicators is a supporting tool to study  feeding habits, nutrient tracking, species migrations and habitat use of  species and communities in the ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Thompson}</cite> In addition, <b>modelling techniques</b> have been introduced to study ecosystem responses to different stressors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Christensen2007}</cite>&nbsp;An  ecosystem model can be used to compute a group of indicators describing  the physical attributes, lower trophic levels (phyto- and zooplankton  mainly in pelagic systems), higher trophic levels, and ecosystem  principles. Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling  techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the  ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an  indicator would take under different situations. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><div>Another approach, proposed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hattam2015}</cite>,  using the Dogger Bank as a case study, underlines the need to link  indicators into three main classifications. Ecosystem services, the  first classification, &nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of  ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010). Ecosystem functions, the  second classification refers to ecological mechanisms which regulate the  flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cardinale2012}</cite>   . The classification ecosystem benefits describes the processed output  from ecosystem services, which is therby no longer linked to the  ecosystem  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haines-Young2012}</cite>  . Identifying sufficient service, function and benefit indicators  remains a challenge due to the complexity of marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</div><div>However,  once the proper indicators for each classification are chosen, and they  are assessed in conjunction, they can give a more complete  understanding of how an ecosystem changes.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Hattam2015}</cite></div><div>                                        This change  leads us to the  different impacts causing the ecosystem change and their short and long  term considerations.</div><h3 data-label="455145" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Short term and long term considerations</h3><div>                                        &nbsp;As already  shown before, using an already known concept to describe a new problem could  help to simplify and understand several complex topics. So there was an  application of a human health metaphor suggested to transfer this on assessing  ecosystem health using different indicators. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite></div><div>    Due  to the fact, that the main research goal of this project is to contribute to  greater understanding of how to assess the impacts and effects of multiple  stressors in marine ecosystems in our current time of climate and environmental  change, we should try to simplify this complex web of different stressors  interacting with each other to get a general overview of the ongoing changes.  Thus, it is beneficial to review the concept of assessing ecosystem health to  understand the assessing of multiple stressors and their interactions.</div><div>    The  “aquatic ecosystem distress syndrome” lists different symptoms characterizing  ecosystem health, such as: alteration in biotic community structure to favour  smaller forms, reduced species diversity, increased dominance by ‘r’ selected  species, increased dominance by exotic species, shortened food-chain length,  increased disease prevalence, and reduced population stability.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rapport_1992}</cite>&nbsp;All these  symptoms are abiotic and biotic factors in ecosystems and there are more, such  as temperature, pH, nutrients, gas concentration, species concurrence,  migration, etc. For all these abiotic and biotic factors one can apply the maxim for complex metabolic or ecosystem processes, called  “Blackman’s principle”. According to this principle, the rate of the process is  limited by the pace of the slowest abiotic or biotic factor, when the process  is conditioned as to its rapidity by a number of separate factors. Blackman used this principle specifically to describe the metabolic process of photosynthesis.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{BLACKMAN_1905}</cite>&nbsp;To  illustrate this, imagine a large wine cask, where one of the planks is shorter  than the others. This means it is not possible to fill more wine in the cask  than the high of the shortest plank. The shortest plank in this case functions  as a metaphor for the limiting abiotic or biotic factor.&nbsp;</div><div>    Transferring  this concept to an ecosystem with multiple interacting stressors, this could  help to find a method for assessing multiple stressors and improve their  impacts and effects on marine ecosystems. Considering different ways of  classifying, grouping, quantifying and understanding stressors and the systems  they impact at various organizational levels, according to the Blackman’s  principle, there (probably) is a limiting factor. </div><div>    In a  study of the Australian Institute of Marine Science it is mentioned, that in a  short time perspective, it could help to improve local stressors with an acute  impact in marine ecosystems, but in long term there is most likely a  stabilization of the ocean temperature needed to prevent the coral losses in  marine ecosystems, because, in this case, temperature as a stressor causes a  lot of other negative impacts and effects on the marine ecosystems. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{De_ath_2012}</cite>&nbsp;Thus, temperature would be the limiting factor or stressor. This means, even if  one, theoretically, improves all other stressors, in a long term perspective not  all changes in the ecosystem health could be prevented, due temperature rise  would still have a quite big impact on the condition of the ecosystem. </div><div>    The  Blackman’s principle thus gives us a general idea on how to improve ecosystem  health and minimize the impacts and effects of multiple stressors in a long  term perspective by finding the limiting stressor, which is most likely the  rise of CO<sub>2</sub> and thus temperature.</div><div>    So  all in all, the concept of ecosystem health could be useful to be able to  assess and predict how marine organisms and their ecosystems will adapt and  respond to different stressors acting in unison, and also which the most significant  or substantial ones are, so we can suggest a systematic framework of these  colossal changes to integrate the effects less universal stressors into.</div><h1 data-label="147465" class="ltx_title_section">                        </h1><div></div><h1 data-label="147465" class="ltx_title_section">Key stressors and potential interactions</h1><h2 data-label="765431" class="ltx_title_subsection"> &nbsp;</h2><div>                                 The complexity of the assessment of  multiple stressors lies in the complexity of the interactions themselves.<i>&nbsp;</i>Even though great advances in this  field have been done, most cumulative effects of mutual influences between  stressors remains uncertain.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div>First of all, stressors are defined as “any  external abiotic or biotic factor that moves a biological system out of its  normal operating range” <a href="#Segner2014"><i>(Segner et al., 2014)</i></a> It is important to differentiate the concepts: stressor, stress, and stress  response.&nbsp;While a stressor is an external factor,&nbsp;stress is an  internal state created by a stressor, and&nbsp;stress response is a cascade of  internal changes caused by stress.&nbsp;<a href="#StraalenN__dot__M__dot__2003"><i>(Straalen N.M., 2003)</i></a></div><div>    We can group marine stressors in two main  categories: a group that acts globally such as increased temperature, ocean  deoxygenation (the global trend of decreasing oxygen as a result of ocean  warming and increasing stratification) and ocean acidification; and those that  act at a local to regional level but occur globally, such as overfishing which  is responsible of species loss and population collapse due to the chain effect  it has on all the food chain, pollution and hypoxia.&nbsp;<a href="#Porter1999"><i>(Porter  et al., 1999)</i></a></div><div>    In order to evaluate the several effects of  multiple stressors, three classifications based on the impacts upon one  another have been done; called synergistic, antagonistic, and additive effects. These effects are also determined by temporal patters, such as if they are simultaneous or continuous,  and the strength of the stressor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite></div><div>    Synergistic interactions have an effect  greater than the sum of the stressors separated, as in the case of the  interaction between ocean acidification and ocean warming. In situations with  three or more stressors, synergies are expected to be the most prevalent  interaction type.     &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{i2017}</cite>&nbsp;  On the  other hand, in antagonistic interactions, stressors reduce one another's effects.  This may be the case where the first of two or more consecutive stressors  preadapt the receptors so they present tolerance to the next ones. Moreover, we  can observe it in the ocean between nutrients and toxins, where the negative  effect of toxins is counterbalanced with the positive effect of nutrients.&nbsp;    &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{i2017}</cite>&nbsp; Lastly,  additive interactions are the sum of the effects and have no additional strength.  Interactions between different chemicals, for example, use to be additive.     &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{i2017}</cite>&nbsp;   &nbsp;</div><div>    Previously, it has been stated the demanding task of understanding the whole picture of stressors' mutal influences. For this reason, in order to have a wide overview  of the marine stressors and their interactions, we have generated a mind map&nbsp; (Fig. 1). The principal purpose of this diagram is to provide as comprehensive  a picture as possible of the complexity of the overall situation, rather than  listing all the effects and consequences between different stressors. This is  partly due to the lack of information about their cumulative effects in  addition to the countless possibilities and variations.</div><div></div>
