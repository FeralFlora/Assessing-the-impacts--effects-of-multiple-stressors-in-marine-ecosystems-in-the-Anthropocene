Any indicator should be sensitive enough to provide an early warning of change,&nbsp;be able to detect changes over a wide geographical area and capable of providing a continuous assessment over many different  stressors. Furthermore, an indicator should be relatively independent of sample size, easy and cost-effective to measure, collect and calculate and able to understand the differences between the natural cycles or trends and the human  induced stressors.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3 data-label="869012" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Biomarkers</h3><div>Thermal stress is one indicator in the present height of research and concern. As anthropogenic activity increases the temperature of the ocean, many marine communities show signs of stress as an effect of the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. Evaluating certain aspects of the ocean can help us understand, predict, and hopefully slow down the impacts imposed by human existence. But how can we start evaluation of stress? Researchers look for biomarkers which can indicate &nbsp;environmental change.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Sammarco2013}</cite></div><div>Physical appearance is a possible key biomarker, a quantifiable characteristic in which can be measured and  can help identify a biological process,&nbsp; of stressor impacts on coral reefs as&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Cooper2009}</cite> point out a prime example of this in the symbiotic relationship between corals and microalgae, and the joint pigmentation they produce. Within coral live photosynthetic dinoflagellate, a type of microscopic algae. The two organisms live in symbiosis; the coral providing accommodation, carbon dioxide, and nutrients while the algae supply molecular oxygen produced by photosynthesis and also fixed carbon which aids in the coral’s energy requirements.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sammarco2013,Solayan2016,corals}</cite> Brightness in corals is a direct effect of the corals having light-absorbing compounds that result in pigmentation but they are aided by the pigments found in their symbiont photosynthetic microscopic organisms.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite> Measuring this pigmentation is a potential assessment tool in assessing water quality and furthermore, the overall health of the ecosystem. Water quality is defined as a change in its chemistry, including changes in the concentration of the amount of nutrients, rates of sedimentation and levels of turbidity’. Considering that the symbiotic pair is sensitive to water quality shifting, any changes will directly affect the microorganisms in the possible changes described before. Therefore, by measuring the pigmentation of both coral and the microscopic algae, one can gain an understanding of the surrounding water quality.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cooper2009}</cite>.</div><div>Another efficient tool for scientists who want to evaluate the health of an ecosystem is the use of empirical estimated indicators, which are categorized into primary producers and primary consumers.</div><h3 data-label="536979" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">                                   Single trophic level indicators</h3><div>          &nbsp;Primary producers are indicators which consist of the phytoplankton and the phytobenthic groups. Tracking phytoplankton’s fast growth rates and response to low levels pollutants, scientists can identify sensitive and early signs­­ of ecological changes and environmental disturbance in marine surface waters. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{PAERL_2003}</cite>&nbsp;Phytobenthic groups are sensitive indicators of changes in marine environments as they  live long and they usually are sessile organisms. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,VanHoey2010}</cite>&nbsp;Macrobenthic communities also undergo chronic disturbances which affect their diversity, total abundance and total biomass and this may help the scientists identify modifications in the trophic structure and functioning of an ecosystem. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,Dauvin_2007,Warwick_1994,article}</cite></div><div>Primary consumer indicators include the zooplankton and zoobenthic groups. In 2005, the professor Weijerman mentioned that the abundance of zooplankton species can be used to document sudden ecosystem shifts in different regions of the world and also help identify the effects of global warming and its consequences on regional hydrodynamics. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Beaugrand2009}</cite>&nbsp;As regard to zoobenthic groups, their structural characteristics can be useful to monitor the impacts of environmental stress in coastal systems <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007}</cite>&nbsp;and they can also be used in detecting early environmental disturbances, especially in estuarine habitats.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dauvin2007,Elliott2007}</cite></div><h3 data-label="931246" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Two or more trophic level indicators</h3><div>The restriction of using these empirical estimated indicators, however, is that they can demonstrate the state of an ecosystem examining only a single trophic level. The need for assessing the ecosystem health in two or more trophic levels led scientists to introduce different approaches. </div><div>The use of stable isotope profiles as environmental and trophic indicators is a supporting tool to study feeding habits, nutrient tracking, species migrations and habitat use of species and communities in the ecosystem.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Thompson}</cite> In addition, modelling techniques have been introduced to study ecosystem responses to different stressors. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Christensen2007}</cite>&nbsp;An ecosystem model can be used to compute a group of indicators describing the physical attributes, lower trophic levels (phyto- and zooplankton mainly in pelagic systems), higher trophic levels, and ecosystem principles. Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an indicator would take under different situations. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3 data-label="617416" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Classification of Ecosystems</h3><div>Another approach, proposed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hattam2015}</cite>, using the Dogger Bank as a case study, underlines the need to link indicators into three main classifications. Ecosystem services, the first classification, &nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010). Ecosystem functions, the second classification refers to ecological mechanisms which regulate the flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cardinale2012}</cite>  .
