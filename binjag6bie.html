Furthermore, an interesting advantage of using modelling techniques is that they can simulate future ecosystem states of the ecosystem under various scenarios, and predict the values that an indicator would take under different situations. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Rombouts_2013}</cite></div><h3 data-label="617416" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Classification of Ecosystems</h3><div>Another approach, proposed by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Hattam2015}</cite>, using the Dogger Bank as a case study, underlines the need to link indicators into three main classifications. Ecosystem services, the first classification, &nbsp;is “the direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human well-being” (TEEB, 2010). Ecosystem functions, the second classification refers to ecological mechanisms which regulate the flow of energy, nutrients and organic matter  <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Cardinale2012}</cite>  . The classification ecosystem benefits describes the processed output from ecosystem services, which is therby no longer linked to the ecosystem  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Haines-Young2012}</cite> . Identifying sufficient service, function and benefit indicators remains a challenge due to the complexity of marine ecosystems.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
