Tracking phytoplankton’s fast growth rates and response to low levels pollutants, scientists can identify sensitive and early signs­­ of ecological changes and environmental disturbance in marine surface waters. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{PAERL_2003}</cite>&nbsp;Phytobenthic groups are sensitive indicators of changes in marine environments as they  live long and they usually are sessile organisms. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,VanHoey2010}</cite>&nbsp;Macrobenthic communities also undergo chronic disturbances which affect their diversity, total abundance and total biomass and this may help the scientists identify modifications in the trophic structure and functioning of an ecosystem. <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Borja_2008,Dauvin_2007,Warwick_1994,article}</cite></div><div>Primary consumer indicators include the zooplankton and zoobenthic groups.
