It is the largest living structure on earth, stretching for over 2300 km in the northern-east region of Australia. While being mostly known for the endless network of coral reefs, its intricate architecture also provides a home for a great amount of animals and plants, creating one of the most biodiverse and complex ecosystem on the planet. Unfortunately&nbsp; the functional biodiversity of the GBR renders its system highly susceptible to even the smallest change in the balance acquired with thousands of years of evolution&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mouillot_2014}</cite>.&nbsp;</div>
