<div>    We can group marine stressors in two main  categories: a group that acts globally such as increased temperature, ocean  deoxygenation (the global trend of decreasing oxygen as a result of ocean  warming and increasing stratification) and ocean acidification; and those that  act at a local to regional level but occur globally, such as overfishing which  is responsible of species loss and population collapse due to the chain effect  it has on all the food chain, pollution and hypoxia.&nbsp;<a href="#Porter1999"><i>(Porter  et al., 1999)</i></a></div><div>    In order to evaluate the several effects of  multiple stressors, three classifications based on the impacts upon one  another have been done; called synergistic, antagonistic, and additive effects. These effects are also determined by temporal patters, such as if they are simultaneous or continuous,  and the strength of the stressor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Crain2008}</cite></div><div>    Synergistic interactions have an effect  greater than the sum of the stressors separated, as in the case of the  interaction between ocean acidification and ocean warming. In situations with  three or more stressors, synergies are expected to be the most prevalent  interaction type.       On the  other hand, in antagonistic interactions, stressors reduce one another's effects.  This may be the case where the first of two or more consecutive stressors  preadapt the receptors so they present tolerance to the next ones. Moreover, we  can observe it in the ocean between nutrients and toxins, where the negative  effect of toxins is counterbalanced with the positive effect of nutrients. Lastly,  additive interactions are the sum of the effects and have no additional strength.  Interactions between different chemicals, for example, use to be additive.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{2016}</cite></div><div>    Previously, it has been stated the demanding task of understanding the whole picture of stressors' mutual influences. For this reason, in order to have a wide overview  of the marine stressors and their interactions, we have generated a mind map (Fig. 1). The principal purpose of this diagram is to provide as comprehensive   as possible a picture of the complexity of the overall situation, rather than  listing all the effects and consequences between different stressors. This is  partly due to the lack of information about their cumulative effects in  addition to the countless possibilities and variations.</div>
