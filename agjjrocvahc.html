<div>These methods are not always simple and cost-effective to collect, evaluate and rank, because you need a lot of data and expert opinions. Furthermore, expert elicitation has a high possibility of being biased or at least subject to uncertainty and a lack of replicability and transparency in the assessment process. Therefore, the comparability of the results, when applying the method&nbsp;to other locations and comparing to other studies, depends on the sufficiency of the data to give reliable information about the examined ecosystem, which is impaired by the aforementioned factors. This makes it difficult to provide early warning of a change and identify potential interactions between the multiple stressors over time and to&nbsp;provide a future envision on possible interactions between the multiple stressors and ecosystem's degradation.</div>
