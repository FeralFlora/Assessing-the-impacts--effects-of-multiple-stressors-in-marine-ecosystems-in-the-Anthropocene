<div>Applicability of the multiple stressor methods</div><div>To address the applicability of the various multiple stressor assessment methods at different trophic and organisational levels is necessary to comment on the potential usability of these methods. As we've framed the focus of our project at the ecosystem level, the methods we are interested in should facilitate assessment of cumulative impacts at this level, rather than only provide insights into population or community level impacts and changes. But what exactly is understood by impacts assessments at an ecosystem level, and are such assessments within scientific reach? These questions will now be addressed.</div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Halll}</cite></div><div><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Tett2013}</cite></div><div></div><div>Model and method validations (<b>mesocosm studies, predicting historical changes / events etc.</b>)</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h3 data-label="517576" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"> </h3><h3 data-label="837411" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    Recommended order and steps in multiple stressor assessments </h3><h3 data-label="837411" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">    </h3><div><b>IDEA (Based on AOPs "</b> Interactions between chemical and climate stressors: A role for mechanistic toxicology in assessing climate change risks<b>"):</b></div><ul><li>Make a large, shared database of various impact pathways, each described in a unified way.</li><li>Then, incorporate this database into software that can assemble complex AOPs, integrating the impacts into a prediction of the outcome of the population in question.</li><li>The results might not be accurate, but they can give an inclination of the possible outcomes.</li></ul><div>STEPS:</div><ol><li><b>Stressor ranking and identification (stessor inventory):</b> "Rating impacts in a multi-stressor world: a quantitive assessment of 50 stressors affecting the Great Lakes"</li><li><b>Cumulative impact mapping:</b> "Mapping cumulative human impacts to California Current marine ecosystems"</li><li><b>Ecological network map</b> (conceptual ecosystem or community model)</li><li><b>Interstressor effects and causative relation to potential biological changes</b> (AOPs): "Characterizing driver-response relationships in marine pelagic ecosystems for improved ocean management"</li><li></li></ol><h3 data-label="517576" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">

It is the largest living structure on earth, stretching for over 2300 km in the northern-east region of Australia. While being mostly known for the endless network of coral reefs, its intricate architecture also provides a home for a great amount of animals and plants, creating one of the most biodiverse and complex ecosystem on the planet. Unfortunately&nbsp; the functional biodiversity of the GBR renders its system highly susceptible to even the smallest change in the balance acquired with thousands of years of evolution&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mouillot_2014}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Mouillot_2014}</cite>.&nbsp;</div>
